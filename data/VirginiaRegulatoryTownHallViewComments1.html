        <strong>Guidance Document Change:</strong> Every day, throughout
 the Commonwealth of Virginia, educators and school leaders work to 
ensure that all students have an opportunity to receive a high-quality 
education. As a part of that work, educators strive to meet the 
individual needs of all students entrusted to their care, and
teachers work to create educational environments where all students 
thrive. The Virginia Department of Education (the “Department”) 
recognizes that each child is a unique individual with distinctive 
abilities and characteristics that should be valued and respected. All 
students have the right to attend school in an environment free from 
discrimination, harassment, or bullying.

The Department supports efforts to protect and encourage respect for all
 students. Thus, we have a collective responsibility to address topics 
such as the treatment of transgender students with necessary compassion 
and respect for all students. 

The Department also fully acknowledges the rights of parents to exercise
 their fundamental rights granted by the Fourteenth Amendment of the 
U.S. Constitution to direct the care, upbringing, and education of their
 children. The Code of Virginia reaffirms the rights of parents to 
determine how their children will be raised and educated. Empowering 
parents is not only a fundamental right, but it is essential to 
improving outcomes for all children in Virginia.

The Department is mindful of constitutional protections that prohibit 
governmental entities from requiring individuals to adhere to or adopt a
 particular ideological belief. The First Amendment of the U.S. 
Constitution guarantees religious freedom and prohibits the government 
from compelling speech that is contrary to an individual’s personal or 
religious beliefs.

The Department embarked on a thorough review of the Model Policies 
Guidance adopted on March 4, 2021 (the “2021 Model Policies”). The 2021 
Model Policies promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural
 and social transformation in schools. The 2021 Model Policies also 
disregarded the rights of parents and ignored other legal and 
constitutional principles that significantly impact how schools educate 
students, including transgender students. With the publication of these 
2022 Model Policies (the “2022 Model Policies”), the Department hereby
withdraws the 2021 Model Policies, which shall have no further force and
 effect.

The Department issues the 2022 Model Policies to provide clear, 
accurate, and useful guidance to Virginia school boards that align with 
statutory provisions governing the Model Policies. See Code of Virginia,
 § 22.1-23.3 (the “Act”). Significantly, the 2022 Model Policies also 
consider over 9,000 comments submitted to the Department during the 
public comment period for the 2021 Model Policies.

<p>This attempt to keep trans children from affirming their gender in 
the most vulnerable place they can be is a clear disregard for 
children’s lives and an attempt at nothing but conveying control over 
children with an extremely partisan belief. <br>Trans children are more 
likely to commit suicide over cis children. To declare any type of 
protection for children and then disregarding their right to be and 
simply just use a bathroom (a place that should be of extremely little 
concern of adults) makes the original argument disingenuous at 
best.&nbsp;<br>Protect children by allowing them the respect to make 
decisions regarding their own mental health and their decision to choose
 where to mind their own business without adults obsessing over their 
genitalia.</p>

<p>I fully support the proposed 2022 Guidelines. &nbsp;The 2021 Guidance
 put schools in the position of severing the parent-child relationship, 
of deciding what is best for a child and of unduly influencing a minor 
child. &nbsp;While supportive schools are essential, and the rights of 
every student are equally important, parents know, love and care for 
their children far more than schools, which are transient in a child's 
life. &nbsp;The previous 2021 guidance went far beyond State and Federal
 Law in wresting decision-making and authority away from parents and 
handing it over to schools and non-guardians. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This new guidance appropriately revokes the deceit authorized by the 
2021 guidance, which in practice directed schools to conceal its 
interactions with a minor child, whether over counseling or use of 
pronouns, facilities etc. This deceitful aspect of the 2021 guidance was
 one of its most problematic and dangerous features.</p>
<p>The previous guidance also cited and relied on resources only from 
ideological groups and smaller committees of medical professionals. 
&nbsp;There is growing evidence, internationally and nationally, of harm
 from rushing children to gender transition, and the previous guidance 
fostered this by its complete omission of full research. &nbsp;Most 
countries in Europe are moving away from the gender-affirming only 
approach, because of the accumulating evidence of harm to children. 
&nbsp;Schools should never take on the role of influencing a child's 
sexuality or gender identity, and the previous guidance put schools in 
this position by an entirely one-sided approach to gender, rather than a
 balanced one as would be true of an evidence-based approach. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the previous guidance put girls and women in harm's way
 by allowing males into all their safe spaces. &nbsp;While the intent of
 the 2021 guidance is to allow transgender students to chose facilities,
 the practice in the way it is worded disallows questioning of any male 
entering a female space. &nbsp;Further, the population of girls and 
women who have been victims of sexual assault is far greater than the 
population of transgender students, and it is wrong and dangerous for 
these women to have to fear males entering private spaces with them. 
There are reasonable and fair ways to protect transgender students 
without taking away the right to privacy and safety of every female in 
the system.</p>
<p>Further, the former guidance unlawfully compelled speech as to 
pronoun usage, again going far beyond both State and federal law. 
&nbsp;Every child deserves equal respect, but the law does not grant 
them the right to compel the speech of others.</p>
<p>Every school will have to work out ways to respect and support 
transgender children, including for children who may face danger at 
home. It goes without question that support, compassion and respect are 
essential to caring for transgender children in schools. The answer, 
however, is not a blanket order affecting all families by unlawfully 
removing parental authority and involvement from a child's life, as was 
the effect of the previous guidance. &nbsp;Schools and counselors should
 be partners with children and parents, not usurpers of parental roles.</p>
<p>This policy is a great step forward in removing the excesses of the 2021 Guidance.</p>

change that . He was elected because Terry McAuliffe stated the obvious .
 School Boards decide issues with schools . Parents who listen to out of
 their f***ing mind republicans do not run the schools . I hope all you

<p>I support the new VDOE guidelines for schools. It’s time to get back 
to reading, writing, and arithmetic and stop the woke nonsense. Pushing 
pronouns on kids. Allowing children of the opposite sex in bathrooms and
 locker rooms is beyond ridiculous. Thanks you Governor Youngkin for 
bringing sanity back to our schools.</p>

<p>Parents need to educate their children before school. &nbsp;Boys pee 
standing up, girls sit. &nbsp;Keep this crap out of the schools. 
&nbsp;Believe in GOD and you will see the light of this nonsense.

<p>Names matter and every kid deserves to be called by their chosen name without question.</p>
<p>I moved to VA in the middle of kindergarten. My new teacher was an 
old bat named Mrs. Vannoy who insisted that all children be called by 
their proper names. My proper name was Deborah and despite my parents 
telling her that I went by Debbie, she refused to call me by that name. 
To this day, I still cringe a little when I hear people use it because I
 grew to hate my own name by a teacher who wouldn't listen. Furthermore,
 I knew how to spell Debbie but not Deborah so imagine being a kid in 
school who doesn't know how to spell your own name.</p>
<p>As a teacher, I have kids that go by many names that aren't their own
 given name. Being a Southerner, most of my family goes by either a 
nickname or some other name like a middle name. I have friends who I 
don't know their real names because I've always known them by a 
nickname. NO ONE QUESTIONS THIS and they shouldn't. But if one day, if 
Amy wants to be known as Aiden or Michael wants to go by Chelle, it's 
suddenly harmful to the child - to use a name they chose.</p>
<p>We need to stop this nonsense and use the money creating these 
bigoted bills (and the ensuing lawsuits) to do something really useful 
like give school staff raises, purchase school supplies, and fix 
crumbling school infrastructure.</p>

<p>The 2021 model policy blinded parents to what was going on at school 
with their own children. There is never a reason to exclude parents from
 the educational/social experiences of their children. Never. &nbsp;The 
state is not the parent. Period.</p>

<p>100% yes.&nbsp;<br>It is unlawful for Schools to take away parental 
rights. The high suicide rates with the transgender community are not 
because of the parents But rather because of the system failing a child,
 allowing the child to cut off their genitalia, and pursue a sex change 
at a very young age before the child has the sense that it is forever 
changing their future. Once the child realizes that they were pressured 
into an unalterable sex change, they will clearly be angry at the school
 system, their community, and their parents for failing them. A girl who
 has her breasts removed will never be able to nurse her children, and 
also worse may never be able to have children after the surgery. The 
fact that parents would not be involved in something so significant is 
criminal. This of course needs to change because parents to have rights 
despite what the school boards are pushing.</p>

<p>Let kids be kids and let them be called by whatever names they want. 
We all changed names at least once when we were their age. Are we 
damaged? No.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Bathrooms are a non-issue as well. Kids don't even get bathroom
 breaks these days anyway because schools are too concerned about vaping
 and fights.</p>
<p>Stop this nonsense and tell parents if they want to be more involved 
in their kid's lives, they need to BE A PARENT and not demand that the 
schools do everything for them. They also need to spend time with their 
kids instead of yelling at school board meetings or complaining that 
teachers never tell them anything even though their kid has dozens of 
crumpled up notes from their teacher buried in their backpack.</p>

<p>Kids might not know what they want to be when they grow up (I’m 
50-something, and I’m still not too sure) but they do know who they are 
inside better than anyone else. It hurts no one to call a child by their
 chosen name. As an early childhood educator, I learned whole school 
fulls of children's names, and some <em>gasp</em>&nbsp;were nicknames or even middle names. </p>
<p>It’s no longer acceptable to cram people into the box some small mind
 thinks they fit into, regardless of who they actually are, until they 
succumb to depression or anxiety or descend to the point of suicide. 
Every kid deserves a chance to reach their full potential, and for that 
to happen, they all need to feel equally safe in school.</p>

<p>Schools need to get out of the way and stick to the basics of 
education. Their ONLY focus should be teaching children how to read, 
Write etc. keep this nonsense out of our schools. The forceful gender 
ideology is criminal and doesn’t belong in lesson plans, advisory Etc. 
Get back to education not what is equitable&nbsp;</p>

<p>This proposal is another Republican led effort to harken back to the 
imaginary days of the Donna Reed Show, Leave It To Beaver and Father

hour, parents were perfect and children had no serious issues.&nbsp; 
Like the proposal, the shows did little to protect the most vulnerable

<p>The proposal may make for good politics, but at a terrible and needless costs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a shortsighted policy that will lead to more kids committing 
suicide. People need to be supported for who they are, and the people 
who put information on a piece of paper when they were born and too 
young to have agency do not know that person as well as the person 
themself.</p>
<p>Even if the argument of compassion doesn’t sway you, think of the 
argument of sense. This policy forbids nicknames. I don’t think I’ve 
ever heard any government overreach more petty and draconian that this.</p>

Schools against trans policy. Our kids don't belong to the state. CRT

<p>I fully support Gov Youngkin’s policy to require parents to agree to 
the pronoun students are called. I fully believe the education system, 
as well as most public policies, protect the rights of the very small 
minority and trounce on the rights of the majority of students and the 
teachers alike. They should not be held responsible for remembering what
 someone chooses to be called. Parents need to be more active in these 
important decisions as that is their responsibility as a parent! Letting
 children choose encourages more ridiculousness like identifying as a 
cat or dog and this IS happening also. Where do we draw the line. When 
they leave the education system they can be whatever they choose but as 
long as they are under 18 parents are the deciding factor and let’s hope
 they have the good sense to be a sensible guidance to their 
child.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>CRT, Trans Policies for FCPS  Parents Rights Against </strong>

<p>Parents have rights and FCPS has no right to keep things from 
parents. CRT has to stop as well. I fully support Youngkin's policy is 
Schools against trans policy. Our kids don't belong to the state. CRT 
doesn't belomg in the classrooms either. Pronouns shouldn't be used. 
Kids know what gender they are and I believe some teachers, especially 
the school board are causing the students confusion at such young age. 
Allowing students to change their names behind there parents backs is 
dangerous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this proposed policy.&nbsp; This proposal would 
create a hostile and potentially dangerous school environment for our VA
 transgender and nonbinary youth, requiring teachers and staff to 
forcibly “out” students, prohibit staff from supporting trans and 
nonbinary students such as using a students affirming name and pronouns,
 and prohibit access or participation in activities consistent with 
their gender identity.&nbsp; All our students deserve a supportive and 
affirming school environment, especially our vulnerable and marginalized
 populations like our transgender and nonbinary youth.</p>

<p>I oppose the model policies. They are harmful to transgender and 
gender-expansive teens and children. Kids know who they are and need 
adult support.</p>

<p>As a public school teacher, THANK YOU! I don't think a lot of people 
realize what our schools have become. I would like them to be places of 
learning, not social experimentation. Trans kids will have the rest of 
their lives to figure things out. They should do it at home, not at 
school.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Hello,<br><br>I am writing to say that I fully support the Governors proposed changes to the model policies, for three simple reasons:<br><br>1) These policies are leading children into doing irrevocable harm to themselves.<br>2)
 These policies are a clear violation of the freedom of conscience, and 
the first amendment, as it requires students, teachers, and faculty to 
engage in speech they know to be false.<br>3) Our teachers are being 
forced to "right the cosmic injustices" of the world in their 
classrooms. It seems all attention is being paid to leftist political 
theories, rather than academic rigor, and the failing performance of our
 schools, is evidence to this fact. Schools are not a place for radical 
social engineering.&nbsp; <br><br>Thank you for have the courage of your convictions to keep the promise you made to the parents of Virginia. <br><br>Sincerely, <br><br>John T. Wilson</span></p>

<p>I support His policy to require parents to sign off on children 
changing pronouns in school. I feel like this policy should be extended 
to other students as well. I don’t believe it is necessary for others to
 be forced to use “made up” pronouns.</p>

<p>Everyone is different. Everyone deserves to be proud of who they are 
and want to be. Let them be called by the names and pronouns they feel 
comfortable with. Let them use the bathrooms they feel comfortable with.
 This goes for all adults and kids. These kids are some of the most 
vulnerable. Protect them in all ways. They may come from abusive homes. 
There is a duty to protect them from their parents in that case. Do not 
force legal documents for use of comfortable names, pronouns, or 
bathrooms. Give them a safe space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy is a breath of fresh air. &nbsp;Encouraging parents to be
 a part of their children’s lives is (or should be) a no brainer. 
&nbsp;Strengthening&nbsp;the family unit is one of many American values 
that has been thrown to the side in the name of moving the country as 
far left as possible. &nbsp;Not to mention the common sense here - 
you’re either a male or a female. &nbsp;There is no in between. 
&nbsp;Parents - it’s time to start being that. &nbsp;A PARENT! &nbsp;<br><br>Well done Governor Youngkin for using common sense and standing by his principles. &nbsp;Keep up the good work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am in strong support of the new policy. &nbsp;The state, via school
 board policy, has no right or legitimate claim to students over their 
parents. &nbsp;Parents are the primary’s educators of their children and
 must have the ultimate say in their children’s education.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose these changes. Having worked with our youth for the
 past 20 years, I've worked with many transgender students. Stripping 
them of the rights we've provided risks their lives. I have had many 
students who knew they couldn't be honest with their parents at risk for
 their own safety physically and emotionally. Mental health issues are 
at an all time high, why would we intentionally impose legislation that 
we know increases mental health issues in children that could lead to 
more self-harm, anxiety, trauma, and suicide? This is about safety and 
this change would put children at risk.</p>

<p>I fully support Gov Youngkin and applaud his initiative. Children are
 being encouraged To question their gender and schools need to do what 
they were intended to do….educate!!! You have kids graduating that can 
barely read because the focus is now on transgenders, giving sexual 
information and ways to prevent pregnancy! Teach reading, writing and 
common sense math and &nbsp;leave the life decisions to parents and 
their kids.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Completely supportive of the new policies. All children should feel 
safe, not just a small percentage. We have already seen numerous 
assaults with the old policies that pandered to mentally ill children at
 the expense of others. We voted for Governor Youngkin because we wanted
 to be the ones making choices for our children. Children safety is our 
priority. I also would like to see serious penalties for teachers and 
administrators who try to ignore or bypass these guidelines. We have a 
huge issue with this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gender and gender ideology is a fiction, and a religious belief

 community members to adhere to its tenets (including “required” use of 
language).&nbsp;<br>I look forward to the day when the biggest medical

<p>I have been an active supporter of gay rights for over a decade and 
sat on a national board that helped to over turn "Don't Ask, Don't Tell"
 established by U.S. President Bill Clinton.&nbsp; I also worked 
tirelessly to support civil marriage for all consenting adults. These 
were monumental changes in our society that made us a better 
nation.&nbsp; That said, the current movement by educators and some 
politicians who are not board certified in mental health, gender 
dysphoria, and pediatric medicine is profoundly disturbing, unethical, 
and akin to medical malpractice.&nbsp; There is a bright line between 
adult decisions and parental rights and the law in Virginia is quite 
clear and is based on thousands of years of culture and human history 
writ large: <a rel="nofollow" x="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title1/chapter2.1/section1-240.1/">§
 1-240.1. Rights of parents. A parent has a fundamental right to make 
decisions concerning the upbringing, education, and care of the parent's
 child.</a>&nbsp; The attempt by some to separate parents from their 
minor children is chilling and dangerous.&nbsp; It is what Stalin 
attempted to do in the Soviet Union, Pol Pot did in Cambodia, and what 
the Chinese Communist Party is current doing to the &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" x="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/03/1073793823/china-uyghur-children-xinjiang-boarding-school">Uyghur children.</a>
 Educators and politicians who want to separate minor children claim 
parents will abuse or harm children who may have gender dysphoria. Every
 educator and person who works with minor children is legally 
responsible to be a <a rel="nofollow" x="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title63.2/chapter15/section63.2-1509/">mandatory reporter</a>
 so that all children are safe. Mandatory reporters are not to keep 
secrets with minor children from their parents.&nbsp; If they suspect 
abuse they must immediately report that claim to law enforcement. There 
are laws on the books and training for all mandatory reporters to go to 
law enforcement so this argument is moot.&nbsp; Think about this for a 
moment - how would you feel if a teacher gave razor blades to a minor 
child who is cutting themselves to "affirm" their affliction?&nbsp; Or 
if a teacher helped an anorexic girl get fat removed from her body to 
"affirm" her affliction?&nbsp; Affirming any mental health crisis 
without being board certified and without parental permission is caustic
 and destructive behavior.&nbsp; It is insanity.&nbsp; A child in 
Virginia schools cannot take an Tylenol without parental consent and yet
 some elected officials want to put the burden on educators to be a 
board certified medical professional. That is not only unethical it is 
illegal. To that end, this policy makes sense.&nbsp; Removing parents 
from their legal responsibility to make decisions for their minor child 
by the school system is illegal and morally reprehensible.&nbsp; This 
policy is on solid legal and moral footing and reaffirms parental rights
 in Virginia while supporting all children and ensuring educators are 
reminded they are educators and not medical professionals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this proposed policy and request the Superintendent
 reject these changes before irreversible damage is done to our 
children.&nbsp; This proposal would create a hostile and potentially 
dangerous school environment for our VA transgender and nonbinary youth,
 requiring teachers and staff to forcibly “out” students, prohibit staff
 from supporting trans and nonbinary students such as using a students 
affirming name and pronouns, and prohibit access or participation in 
activities consistent with their gender identity.&nbsp; All our students
 deserve a supportive and affirming school environment, especially our 
vulnerable and marginalized populations like our transgender and 
nonbinary youth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Correct pronoun and name use is incredibly critical to the mental and
 physical health of transgender students. The proposed changes to this 
law threaten that health and safety, by only allowing students who feel 
comfortable sharing their gender identity with their parents the right 
of being treated with the respect of their correct name and pronouns. 
There are hundreds of reasons a child might not feel comfortable sharing
 this with their parents - religion, politics, or even just not being 
ready to share with their family yet. The argument that parents have the
 right to raise their children themselves is nonsensical, as it implied 
that teachers are somehow forcing a gender identity onto trans kids by 
respecting their pronouns. Moreover, children request to be called 
different names than their legal name all the time. Will we need 
parental consent to call William Will, or to call someone who prefers 
their middle name by it? This proposed change unfairly targets 
transgender children, and will have dire consequences for their health 
and wellbeing in schools if enacted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the new transgender policy. The policy purports to 
be aimed at supporting parental rights. However, it actually makes it 
harder and more burdensome for parents to support their children who 
already are dealing with tough issues by unrealistically and 
unnecessarily requiring them to provide legal documents to support use 
of different pronouns for their child. Further the policy requiring 
students to use the bathrooms that correspond to their gender assigned 
at birth is harmful mentally and physically to students. The 
department’s policies should be about its STUDENTS and their well-being.
 Instead the new policy is about a politician scoring points with a 
constituency. This is cruel and will have detrimental consequences for 
children—all we should care about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having worked with students in both middle and high schools in 
Virginia for 26 years this policy will only cause damage. Transgender 
youth are already in danger of suicide, self harm, being kicked out of 
their homes, abusive situations at home, as well as targets of bullying 
and harassment to name a few. The previous policies PROTECTED all 
students, this new policy targets transgender youth in a very negative 
way. We already have a mental health crisis in youth and now you want us
 to obtain written statements from parents telling us what name to use 
for their children? Do you not understand that most of these children 
are NOT out to their parents yet for fear of abuse, disownment, 
harassment etc.? This is not a whim or choice, only about 2% of 
transgender students ever change back to cisgender. THEY NEED OUR 
SUPPORT!&nbsp; Our job at school is to protect and provide a safe, 
welcoming environment for ALL students. This policy does not support 
that right and I strongly oppose it.</p>

<p>There are only 2 genders.&nbsp; Everything else is a mental health 
issue that is being ignored by parents and the schools. I am glad to see
 that such behavior is being questioned and dealt with 
appropriately.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The responsibility of remembering what someone should be called 
should not be put on teachers and this nonsense has to stop. Kudos to 
Gov Youngkin for putting some common sense back into the education 
system. It’s time for schools to teach snd parents to parent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Leave the evangelists to do their Work outside of school. Keep our 
schools inclusive. Please take the time to actually talk to families of 
transgender students to better understand their needs. That’s the 
approach that needs to be taken.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the many reasons &nbsp;I left the education system because of 
the lack of parental responsibility and too much government intrusion. 
Children are unable to make up their minds on their sexual 
orientation.&nbsp;<br>Stop pushing pronouns, CRT, and SEL.&nbsp;<br>Please
 focus on academics and encourage parents realize the importance of self
 reliance, and good skills to help them in the future.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br></p>

<p>I am strongly against this attack on transgender people. If a student
 prefers to be called by a nick name in school, there is no problem (my 
name is Christopher but I preferred Chris and my teachers accommodated 
this). Calling a student by there preferred name is just basic respect 
and that should include trans students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, outing transgender students can lead to violence/abuse against 
them and can impact their mental health which could lead to self harm 
and suicide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trans students should feel safe to be themselves just like every 
other student. This policy is blatant discrimination and, on a practical
 note, will be almost impossible to enforce. I know several teachers who
 have said they fully intend to ignore this policy when it is passed. 
Its nothing more than a ridiculous political stunt meant to appease the 
worst parts of the republican base. Virginia students deserve better 
than this from the governor.</p>

<p>Each student is entitled to emotional support from the school 
district they attend. &nbsp;Ignoring the rights of transgender students 
is detrimental to their social and emotional growth as a young person. 
&nbsp;By supporting the existing law concerning these rights, students 
can continue to grow in their journey to adulthood with the help of a 
caring and supportive school environment. In situations where students 
families do not accept or are not comfortable with their child’s 
decisions, perhaps resources can be made available to help them on their
 journey to learn more about the topic and how it applies to their 
situation. Threatening to kick a child out of the house or refusing to 
pay for college is certainly not helpful. The link between school and 
home is strong and anything to help bridge the transition to accepting a
 child’s transgender journey should be explored. Above all, protecting 
the student’s emotional well being must be a priority. Changing the 
existing law does not achieve that goal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am writing to offer my support for the 2022 Guidance policy. For 
too long, there has been a constant abdication of parental rights and 
involvement in the public space with their children. This policy, in my 
opinion, enforces those rights of parents to have a proper say in their 
childrens' upbringing, health and safety. Again, I strongly support this
 guidance</p>

<p>I’m not sure what the general public thinks is going on with 
transgender children in school or in families with trans children, but 
it seems misinformation and fear is guiding most people. Especially 
people who have never talked to transgender kids or families of 
transgender kids,read the actual data from the America Academy of 
Pediatrics or just felt like most parents want what is best for their 
kids. My kid is not a political stand; my kid is not trying to pollute, 
groom, or corrupt your child. My child wants to go to school, use the 
bathroom and not be harassed regularly for who he is. Where are my 
parental rights in this policy? Where are my child’s rights to life, 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness? Policies such as this will end the
 lives of transgender children. It will put a group already at risk into
 more danger. <br>Additionally, there isn’t a magic wand of declaring a 
minor is transgender and immediately that child is “mutilated”. The 
transition period with medical intervention is not immediate or done 
lightly. No parent I know has taken medical transition lightly. We are 
not stupid. We want to do what is best for OUR kid and do what keeps 
them ALIVE. Sometimes those decisions lead to surgery sometimes not. 
Some transgender people NEVER even want surgery. There is not a one size
 fits all to being trans. This policy is a direct reaction to fear and 
misunderstanding and willful ignorance and intentional fear mongering. 
It is wrong. It is judgement without basis in fact. Furthermore, go to a
 typical public school. You will not see trans kids taking over or 
teachers shoving gender issues down anyone’s throat. Teachers have 
enough on their plates and simply (most) just want their students to 
succeed no matter their gender. So leave them alone too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The schools are not the place to discuss sexual identity.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;The schools need to get back to teaching reading, writing and 
arithmetics.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do not support being mean or bullying anyone 
but I also do not support buying into other people's delusions as normal
 behavior.&nbsp; It is very sad that our education system can't teach 
something as basic as girls have a vagina and boys have a penis..&nbsp; 
You guys need to spend more effort towards mental health help.</p>

<p>This policy is horrible for trans youth on so many levels. It’s a sad
 day when one wealthy business &nbsp;man thinks he knows what’s best for
 LGBTQ YOUTH even though he hasn’t consulted any professionals or his 
own DOE reps to draft this policy. Youngkin you have blinders on and now
 you’ll have blood on your hands. You’re either dumb, naive, or full of <img src="VirginiaRegulatoryTownHallViewComments1_files/blackbox.gif" alt="black box" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: middle">…guess
 what, I think you’re all 3! Go consult your people who are in this

aren’t doctors. This isn’t a political issue this is a human issue. Keep
 politics out of our schools bc that’s all this is!&nbsp;</p>

<p>September 26, 2022</p>
<p>The Virginia School Counselor Association (VSCA) opposes the Virginia Department of Education’s&nbsp;<em>2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools</em>&nbsp;as
 they are currently proposed. The 2022 model policies create barriers to
 privacy, dignity, and respect for Virginia’s students and seek to 
undermine previous legislation (i.e.,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" x="https://vsca.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=1NPMOsRnym3Ax4o4aRFLF%2bZYlwvtdnAQicbWsX8Q79rd3bJmS%2brZFXimAWeEr2%2f78Tx9Enh6IOTK%2fXV9bwhaYoha096W4N0kHgjziJ%2bLANg%3d" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vsca.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode%3D1NPMOsRnym3Ax4o4aRFLF%252bZYlwvtdnAQicbWsX8Q79rd3bJmS%252brZFXimAWeEr2%252f78Tx9Enh6IOTK%252fXV9bwhaYoha096W4N0kHgjziJ%252bLANg%253d&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664277562598000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YO7LWiqFW0vbE-jZ_IbUu">§ 22.1-23.3. Treatment of transgender students; policies</a>) that works to create safe and supportive environments for our most vulnerable youth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VSCA recognizes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% 
reported suicidality. School belongingness mitigates these risks and is a
 significant predictor variable for reducing suicidal ideation and 
attempts among transgender youth (Austin et al., 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transgender and nonbinary youth whose schools prevent them from using
 the restrooms/locker rooms that best matched their gender identities 
were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted, 26% for 
transgender males and&nbsp;149% for transgender females (Murchison et 
al., 2019).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted 
suicide in the past year. In fact, when pronouns are respected, 
transgender youth attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did 
not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project, 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transgender adolescents experience significantly disproportionate 
levels of childhood abuse compared to cisgender adolescents and 
experience greater levels of homelessness as a result of being kicked 
out or abused (Thoma, 2021).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fewer than 2.5% of transgender youth re-transition to cisgender (Olson et al, 2022).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Virginia school counselors work to remove barriers and support the 
social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students. VSCA Ends 
Policies state that “Virginia School Counselors&nbsp;are committed to 
working with and advocating for marginalized groups, promote the mental 
health and wellness of all students, adhere to the ASCA Ethical 
Standards for School Counselors, and actively work to dismantle 
destructive systemic inequities.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Virginia school counselors follow the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) Position Statement on&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" x="https://vsca.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=L6RTA1gphhP9lBTZtbUiGvxeQOLbjXsPKpJN13NN0ZrtBKQHMsF8%2fneQe%2bAzXLxuWVy977vSHgZLXgEVMnwXYmBW8%2fbhf9tbNjxDlO5WULI%3d" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vsca.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode%3DL6RTA1gphhP9lBTZtbUiGvxeQOLbjXsPKpJN13NN0ZrtBKQHMsF8%252fneQe%252bAzXLxuWVy977vSHgZLXgEVMnwXYmBW8%252fbhf9tbNjxDlO5WULI%253d&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664277562598000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bYCEtK5kpybkbg0fcpBml">The School Counselor and Transgender and Nonbinary Youth</a>&nbsp;(Adopted 2016, revised 2022) that states:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>School counselors work to safeguard the well-being of transgender and
 nonbinary youth. School counselors recognize all students have the 
right to be treated equally and fairly, with dignity and respect as 
unique individuals, free from discrimination, harassment and bullying 
based on their gender identity and gender expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, Virginia school counselors seek to create environments that 
are not only inclusive and equitable for all students, including our 
transgender, nonbinary, gender non-conforming and gender-fluid students,
 but that celebrate the full scope of their identities, allowing them to
 thrive and reach their fullest potential. Furthermore, Virginia school 
counselors commit to dismantling any and all forms of inequity in 
Virginia’s public education system and fully support LGBTQ+ students. 
Every Virginia student, regardless of their gender identity, gender 
expression, or sexual orientation, has a right to learn free from 
discrimination and harassment.</p>
<p>Against this background, it is VSCA’s stance that the&nbsp;<em>2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools</em>&nbsp;are
 empirically unfounded and are not in accordance with evidence-based 
best practices concerning the treatment of transgender, nonbinary, 
gender non-conforming and gender-fluid students.</p>

<p>This is a parent - child - doctor decision. The horrific memo you put
 out will gravely harm children in the Commonwealth. Just because you 
don’t agree or understand, doesn’t give you the right to chastise, 
malign or harm minors. These children deserve privacy and protection. I 
get it, Glenn, you have bigger fish to fry. You spend more time in other
 states than the one you are supposed to lead. You are quick to judge 
without understanding the bigger picture. Your words and actions could 
lead to disastrous effects. Let the children be who they are inside and 
out. You claimed to govern for all Virginians. You need to protect these
 kids - pray for them, sir. Please do not allow our AG to snoop through 
school files or anything that would compromise a minor child’s private 
info. PROTECT ALL CHILDREN!</p>

<p>I disagree vehemently with the rollback of VA transgender students 
rights. How hard is it for you bigots to just be kind? Going out of your
 way to emotionally harm a very vulnerable group is wrong. Adults should
 know this. Too much ‘religion’ in GOP policies and not enough ‘love thy
 neighbor’ - using your power to make the lives of others emotionally 
difficult is as morally bankrupt as it gets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My transgender child is bullied regularly at school and would drop 
out of it weren’t for some great teachers and programs at his school. 
This policy will only escalate the bullying and destroys his faith in 
ever feeling like he will belong or even survive to adulthood. I’m not 
exaggerating. This is what we have been living with. Most people have no
 idea what this is like. You have no idea how exhausting it is to keep 
your kid positive and hopeful for the future when the government seems 
to be against their existence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some people like to pretend that schools and teachers are assigning 
or encouraging gender and sexual identities. This is false. Affirming 
that what kids believe about their own identity is valuable is just 
respectful. All kids deserve to feel respected and protected at school. 
The proposed policy changes will not respect individual persons. It will
 further marginalize a group that needs more support and 
understanding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the proposed changes to treatment of trans children
 in the Virginia public education system. Implementation of these 
changes would severely impact the mental and emotional health of these 
children who need more understanding and help, not less. The proposal is
 cruel and unnecessary.</p>

<p>The Virginia School Counselor Association (VSCA) opposes the Virginia Department of Education’s&nbsp;<em>2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools</em>&nbsp;as
 they are currently proposed. The 2022 model policies create barriers to
 privacy, dignity, and respect for Virginia’s students and seek to 
undermine previous legislation (i.e.,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vsca.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode%3D1NPMOsRnym3Ax4o4aRFLF%252bZYlwvtdnAQicbWsX8Q79rd3bJmS%252brZFXimAWeEr2%252f78Tx9Enh6IOTK%252fXV9bwhaYoha096W4N0kHgjziJ%252bLANg%253d&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664277562598000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YO7LWiqFW0vbE-jZ_IbUu">§ 22.1-23.3. Treatment of transgender students; policies</a>) that works to create safe and supportive environments for our most vulnerable youth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VSCA recognizes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% 
reported suicidality. School belongingness mitigates these risks and is a
 significant predictor variable for reducing suicidal ideation and 
attempts among transgender youth (Austin et al., 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transgender and nonbinary youth whose schools prevent them from using
 the restrooms/locker rooms that best matched their gender identities 
were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted, 26% for 
transgender males and&nbsp;149% for transgender females (Murchison et 
al., 2019).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted 
suicide in the past year. In fact, when pronouns are respected, 
transgender youth attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did 
not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project, 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transgender adolescents experience significantly disproportionate 
levels of childhood abuse compared to cisgender adolescents and 
experience greater levels of homelessness as a result of being kicked 
out or abused (Thoma, 2021).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fewer than 2.5% of transgender youth re-transition to cisgender (Olson et al, 2022).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Glenn Trumpkin may use his indoor voice a bit more than the other 
leaders of his party but his objective is the same: using hatred against
 a small, vulnerable group for political advantage. He may not have to 
charter airplanes or march through tear gas with a Bible in his hand, 
but this is just classic politics from a political party that no longer 
values truth nor democracy.</p>

<p>The Governor, uninterested and incapable of goading the general 
assembly to change the laws put into place to protect the rights of the 
trans community, wants to make headlines and hurt people in his vain and
 ultimately useless quest for the presidency. He is more than willing to
 waste the time and taxpayer dollars in an attempt to marginalize 
children in the name of the Commonwealth. Going through with these 
changes would be gross on its own, but also it's just straight up 
illegal. Miyares and Glenn will get plenty of opportunities to be on TV 
over this, but they won't get it to stand in court. Embarrassing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am extremely worried how educational policy is shifting In Virginia.</p>
<p>Schools are supposed to provide safe space for educating all students.&nbsp;<br>Changing
 policy for transgender students puts them at risk. This can lead to 
more bullying. Suicide rates are already high, why are you adding 
changing a policy that will make their environment harder? Why are you 
also banning books on any subject that makes you uncomfortable? 
&nbsp;Banning Books eliminates students ability to learn about topics 
that maybe impacting their lives- to find like minded stories to relate 
to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stop going backwards Virginia , be the ones who stand up and do what’s right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy will get children beaten to death across the state. Trans
 children are at extraordinary risk of abuse and harm in unsupported 
home environments, and requiring teachers to contact abusive parents 
will only lead to violence. The governor knows this, and the cruelty is 
the point. Every single person behind this policy should be ashamed of 
themselves and if they had a shred of humanity they would resign.</p>

<p>No child should have to find out that a person who has been changing 
out for gym class next to them for weeks is actually someone of the 
opposite sex. This is not right nor appropriate. Stop forcing the 
majority to placate the extremism of the left. You cannot biologically 
change your sex, 99.9% of the cells in your body will exhibit a 
biological male or female no matter how much someone tries to mutilate 
their bodies. This is a mental health disorder, let parents decide how 
to handle these circumstances in the privacy of their homes &amp; not in
 a place of public education. Allow other children to compete in sports

Thank you Youngkin! Finally some return to sanity!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly disagree with Trans people, child or adult&nbsp; being in 
the same bathroom of a child.&nbsp; The schools in Virginia does not 
have the right or authority to force normal children to be subject to 
such others.&nbsp; Teachers are in school to teach, not to indoctrinated
 normal children to be gay or transgender.&nbsp; &nbsp;Governor Youngkin
 is trying to guarantee all Virginia students are safe in the bathrooms 
and from indoctrination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have heard that in our schools it has become normal for boys to go 
into girls bathrooms.&nbsp; A teacher told me that she found a boy and 
girl in a bathroom getting ready to have sex.&nbsp; High schoolers have 
become afraid to use the bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Political agenda has no place in the school. Parents have the 
responsibility and therefore the autonomy to choose what they see fit 
for their children to learn. Ethical and religious decisions are the 
parents to make. School administrators and teachers are meant to teach 
children the mechanics they need to understand the world and come to 
their own conclusions as the come of age. I am very glad that my child 
is past the school age and&nbsp; not imposed upon by those with an 
agenda that bullies children into a single mindset that divides them 
against others. Diversity applies to all and the Constitution 
acknowledges that. The issues of slavery and gender are being discussed 
as if people today have caused the problem. When Fred Rogers was on 
television, he taught Diversity as a strength and not a dividing issue. 
Parents had the choice to turn off the television or change the 
channel&nbsp; if they disagreed with his message. Parents should have 
the same power with the schools. Government has no place in these 
issues; public schools are failing because they are administered by 
people who are not true educators. True educators build up children for 
success and do not leverage them as pawns to push a political agenda. 
Anyone, regardless of political affiliation, who teaches children need 
to assess the appropriateness of topics for the developmental age of the
 children, with parental approval, and in areas where it is appropriate 
to bring a topic into the classroom, children should be given the 
spectrum of thought on the topic and work with their parents to decide 
their opinion on that topic. Teach diversity as a strength and teach 
children that they all have different traits that can be used for good 
if they work together. Teach children to appreciate differences of 
traits and opinions, and to use them to build a better world.</p>

<p align="left">Dear Virginia Department of Education ,</p>
<p align="left">I just read your 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, 
Dignity, and Respect for all Students and Parents in Virginia Public 
Schools. I must say, it seems to be misnamed. Nowhere in this document 
is the privacy, dignity, or respect of the student addressed. There is a
 lot of information on what rights parents have. There is a lot of 
“peers shouldn’t bully peers” and “this is what cyberbullying looks 
like”, but nowhere is there any consideration given to the student’s 
rights, dignity, or access to personal development/exploration.</p>
<p align="left">Your introduction says, “As a part of that work, 
educators strive to meet the individual needs of all students entrusted 
to their care, and teachers work to create educational environments 
where all students thrive. The Virginia Department of Education... 
recognizes that each child is a unique individual with distinctive 
abilities and characteristics that should be valued and respected. All 
students have the right to attend school in an environment free from 
discrimination, harassment, or bullying. The Department supports efforts
 to protect and encourage respect for all students. Thus, we have a 
collective responsibility to address topics such as the treatment of 
transgender students with necessary compassion and respect for all 
students.” It should be followed up with “but we’re here to destroy this
 in the name of the parents.”</p>
<p align="left">Nowhere is there anything that addresses what to do when
 these things come into conflict. Nowhere is there any guidelines of 
what to do for conflict-resolution. Everything says, “the parent’s word 
goes,” which is stupid and naive. According to you, parents are gods and
 goddesses, since this document does not seriously consider the needs or
 mental health of the child. It doesn’t look into the issues transgender
 youth deal with. Students don’t usually thrive when their parents are <em>controlling</em> them at a distance.</p>
<p align="left">Parents aren’t mental health professionals, and 
shouldn’t be assumed to be such. Rarely, especially in middle and high 
school, do parents understand their kids. The teachers and counselors 
should be able to judge whether a situation is safe to raise the issue. 
It shouldn't be a blanket requirement.</p>
<p align="left">Few parents can talk freely with their kids about such 
sensitive sex/gender topics; mostly because they’ve made their opinions 
quite clear, and kids don’t want to deal with it, risk it, or disappoint
 their parents. Or because the parents don’t like talking about it, or 
can’t really discuss it short of throwing around religious slogans or 
trite phrases. Don’t assume the ideal situation is the reality. It 
rarely is.</p>
<p align="left">Also of note, is the noticeable lack of 
“transgender”-specific school-related content or anything that might 
show that you looked at the other side of the argument. Very few of the 
documents you quote address the specific concerns and problems faced by 
transgender youth. None of the Resources even address transgender 
specifically or exclusively. It’s almost like you don’t want to look at 
what you should be doing to help this community.</p>
<p align="left">None of your arguments talk about what happens when 
parents hurt their children with their intractability. None of your own 
explanation of the rules even mentions transgender youth problems. You 
don't address issues with suicide and depression. Since this involves 
that group of people, shouldn’t some text about it be included? You 
don’t even recognize a student as “transgender” unless their parent 
agrees with it. Which is a pretty big problem, since if parents agree 
with their children’s alignment or lack of it, there are not issues.</p>
<p align="left">Which “9,000+ comments submitted to the Department 
during the public comment period in 2021” did you look at? How many were
 from ticked off parents and religious leaders? Were any from the 
children themselves or their supporters?</p>
<p align="left">This whole thing is to justify a horrible rule that 
eliminates a vital support system, and undercuts the whole purpose of 
counseling. Therapists and counselors are not required to tell parents 
everything they talked about with the student/patient. Teachers often 
have that role too.</p>
<p align="left">Parents aren’t always the best determiners of what their child actually <em>needs</em>. They often are blinded by what they <em>want</em> their child to be, how they expect children of a certain sex to act, or how their own upbringing might make them think.</p>
<p align="left">If the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment and parents’ rights are
 so overarching, why do we have CPS or any child-protection laws? Could 
it be that parents aren’t the perfect arbiters of morals that this 
document implies? If students are to be treated as individuals, so 
should parents. Making it a requirement to let parents know everything 
ignores the fact that the student (the person the school should be 
focused on, whom it is the school’s duty to partly raise) might not be 
able to talk to their parents about things.</p>
<p align="left">So, you’re saying, teachers can’t protect kids from 
their abusive parents. They can’t be confidantes or supporters that can 
help them without letting their parents know. They can’t use their best 
judgment in dealing with issues. Really?</p>
<p align="left">Why should a trained professional’s professional ethics 
and experience be superseded by a parent’s preference? I’d say most of 
this document frames this as a “religious rights” issue, which it isn’t.
 If parents’ religious beliefs can decide what a student learns in a 
public school (which affects a lot of non-believers), when will we stop 
teaching earth science, evolution, and the sun-centric solar system 
because it might tick off the creationists? We’re already removing real 
history because some parents object. We’ve killed most informative sex 
education because some parents disapprove.</p>
<p align="left">If the parents object so vehemently, maybe they should 
home-school or send them to religious schools. That is what the “parents
 right to determine education” really means. When did we stop listening 
to people who actually studied education?</p>
<p align="left">The minute you contact “social services” for suicidal 
trans or gay kids with abusive parents, guess what? The parents are 
informed, which is what the kids don’t need. According to you, the 
parents should be able to raise their kids how they want… so guess what 
the social services is likely to do? Defer to the parents.</p>
<p align="left">There needs to be a middle ground, based on 
circumstances. There needs to be some way a kid can get help from 
teachers or counselors privately. Because sometimes that help guides 
them to understand their parents and see what they might be missing. 
Making teachers etc. essentially informants removes that guidance, 
making the children suspicious, paranoid, and unwilling to ask for help.</p>
<p align="left">So, according to this guidance, teachers and school 
administrators can bully trans-kids. Peers can't. None of your 
high-sounding language about protecting kids from bullying takes into 
account that demanding they are called certain pronouns is bullying. 
It’s insisting they conform in a way that damages them psychologically. 
Same thing with dress codes.</p>
<p align="left">Even you admit that legally, gender dysphoria is a 
“disability”. That means accommodations must be made, and calling them a
 different pronoun or name is hardly “excessive” or “an undue burden”. 
That is the yardstick you’re supposed to use.</p>
<p align="left">Or are you trying to use the ableist argument that since
 they are “disabled” they can be controlled even more, that their needs 
should be ignored if their caregiver decides it? Which isn’t what that 
decision means, and directly contradicts Code of Virginia, § 2.2-3900, 
et seq., which you also quote.</p>
<p align="left">Honestly, the only thing I liked in this whole document was the <em>suggested </em>policy that required single-person bathrooms be available in reasonable numbers.</p>
<p align="left">I think <em>Grimm v Glouchester</em> and <em>Williams v. Kincaid</em>
 are the only times you mention transgender people in any sort of 
supportive way. Everything else defends parents and the rights of a 
teacher to offend and abuse the students.</p>
<p align="left">“Parent engagement in school” doesn’t mean they have 
veto power, and it doesn’t mean the students should be reported on. It 
means that <em>when</em> a parent forms a partnership with the teachers, <em>when</em>
 they take a positive active role in their kid’s learning, the kids 
react well. It shouldn’t mean they can get books banned arbitrarily. It 
doesn’t mean they are the captain of the ship either.</p>
<p align="left">“Parental engagement” also depends on the parent. Some 
parents are extremely toxic, not only to their kids, but the school, 
teachers, and community. But they should be given free rein to form 
policy and instruction? Few of the parents that want this ever engage 
with schools in a partnership way. They regard schools and teachers with
 suspicion.</p>
<p align="left">Nowhere are the wants and needs of the student even 
addressed. Nowhere is there any expectation of parents listening to or 
interacting with teachers in any way that isn’t dictatorial. Beyond a 
“partnership goal". Where they officially have the right to “review and 
comment” on things like books and instruction, you give them the power 
to stop it all together. Laws meant to prevent the release of 
information, you take as proof that parents can do whatever they want.</p>
<p align="left">According to you they have total “control” over their kids. Which is pretty r/insaneparents actually.</p>
<p align="left">The statutes you quote about privacy say parents have 
the right to “review” and “alter” official records. In other words, no 
one else should be able to do that. That has nothing to do with what 
goes on in a classroom, how teachers/peers etc. address students. It has
 nothing to do with how the child refers to themselves. So why is this 
used to justify a parent having to officially agree to what their child 
is called by a teacher?</p>
<p align="left">A lot of the laws you quote are meant to prevent/do one 
thing, but you claim they do another. You expand their reach beyond 
their purview or twist what they mean to say. The mere fact that you do 
this proves that this is a document of ideology not real policy. And if 
schools or state institutions try to push ideology, that’s bad, right? 
Especially if it’s harmful to the students’ mental, emotional, and 
physical well-being.</p>
<p align="left">How do you not see how contradictory these three 
suggested policy items are? Or is this that ridiculous “you’re only 
transgender if your parents say you are” thing?:</p>
<p align="left">“1. Every effort should be made to ensure that a 
transgender student wishing to change his or her means of address is 
treated with respect, compassion, and dignity in the classroom and 
school environment.</p>
<p align="left">2. [School Division] personnel shall refer to each 
student using only (i) the name that appears in the student’s official 
record, or (ii) if the student prefers, using any nickname commonly 
associated with the name that appears in the student’s official record.</p>
<p align="left">3. [School Division] personnel shall refer to each 
student using only the pronouns appropriate to the sex appearing in the 
student’s official record — that is, male pronouns for a student whose 
legal sex is male, and female pronouns for a student whose legal sex is 
female.</p>
<p align="left">How is that showing respect, compassion or dignity to the student?</p>
<p align="left">So, basically, what your document is saying is “Schools shall respect all students” and “Schools shall serve all students” but<em> not really</em>.
 Because when what the student’s needs conflicts with the parent’s 
desires, “Schools shall defer to parents to make the best decisions with
 respect to their children”. No debate, no exceptions. Parents rule. 
Which is stupid and dangerous, as well as extremely contradictory with 
what you say elsewhere.</p>
<p align="left">You pay lip-service to caring about the children, but 
you don’t allow them to be themselves. You frame this as being 
reasonable, but it’s not. You offer excuse after excuse on why you are 
“obligated” to kowtow to parents at the expense of their children. You 
don’t address the needs of the students with gender dysphoria, or how 
“sex-based sports participants are restricted according to biological 
sex” goes against <em>Williams v. Kincaid</em>.</p>
<p align="left">This is VA DOE mostly washing their hands of a 
complicated situation, claiming they can't interfere. It is stupid, 
cruel and short-sighted. But what else should I expect from a department
 that thinks “divisive issues” like slavery, negative history, gender 
issues, and sexual orientation should be banned from schools. When is 
science going to be considered “divisive?” Certain facts and theories 
certainly contradict religious doctrine. Will it fall to “religious 
freedom” too?</p>
<p align="left">If you can’t teach the facts, what’s the point of 
education? If you can’t support the mental health of students who should
 not be discriminated against according to the law, how can you claim to
 “care about all students”? How can you help a student thrive by 
insisting that he or she be called names and pronouns that give them 
dysphoria and make them suicidal? How can you claim to be 
non-discriminatory when your teachers, administrators, etc. model 
discriminatory, disrespectful, and bullying behavior in front of their 
students? What does that tell the other students about what is 
“acceptable behavior” to those with gender dysphoria? And why can’t 
people given the task of running a Department of Education not see the 
problem here?</p>
<p align="left">I know this is long, but you gave me a lot to work with.
 In brief, this policy stinks and does only half of what it claims to be
 written to do. And none of that helps the student, just the parents.</p>
<p align="left">And just remember, these students are going to be voters, some of them really soon.</p>

<p>Students should have a welcoming and safe space in their schools. If 
this legislation were to pass, that welcoming/safe space would no longer
 be available for many students. Our children already face so many 
challenges throughout their life, they should not have to hide 
themselves in order to maintain a modicum of safety. The mental health 
of trans, non-binary, and gender fluid students is at risk. If their 
possibly only source of support is cut off through this legislation, it 
can lead to catastrophic results for our children and their families. 
Students have shared they are afraid of what will happen if this 
legislation goes into effect. They are afraid for their safety. Many 
students do not have supportive families to help them through difficult 
times and depend on the safety net of a trusted school employee. Please 
don't take that away from them.</p>

<div>I'm a middle school counselor in Chesterfield County Public Schools and the facilitator of our Gay Straight Alliance club. I <strong>strongly oppose</strong>&nbsp;the
 governor's new "2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and 
Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The 2021 policies were exceptional&nbsp;at supporting transgender 
students, and I've seen the positive effect on my transgender students 
when school staff are accepting and affirming of their gender identity 
and chosen name and pronouns. In fact, some of my transgender students 
are flourishing this year with the support we're providing them.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The governor's new 2022 policy will harm transgender students, 
plain and simple. Many transgender students are not ready to come out to
 their parents, and the 2022 policy forces them to do so--potentially 
putting themselves in danger at home--if they want to be exist as their 
authentic selves at school. The 2022 policy will also put transgender 
students at higher risk of suicide.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Transgender students are already a population with high risk 
factors. The 2022 policy is not based on evidence or research. In fact, 
the evidence and research runs&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">contrary</span>&nbsp;to the 2022 policy:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% 
reported suicidality. School belongingness mitigates these risks and is a
 significant predictor variable for reducing suicidal ideation and 
attempts among transgender youth (Austin et al., 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transgender and nonbinary youth whose schools prevent them from using
 the restrooms/locker rooms that best matched their gender identities 
were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted, 26% for 
transgender males and&nbsp;149% for transgender females (Murchison et 
al., 2019).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted 
suicide in the past year. In fact, when pronouns are respected, 
transgender youth attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did 
not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project, 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transgender adolescents experience significantly disproportionate 
levels of childhood abuse compared to cisgender adolescents and 
experience greater levels of homelessness as a result of being kicked 
out or abused (Thoma, 2021).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The number one priority 
of Virginia public schools is to keep our students safe. In order to 
keep our transgender student safe, we cannot enact the 2022 policy. It's
 as simple as that.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for taking the&nbsp;time to read my message and take my 
opinion--based on my professional training and practice--into 
consideration.</div>

<p>The revisions to the policies protecting trans kids will do much more
 harm than good. These are vulnerable kids and the revisions will likely
 increase the bullying and harassement that causes trans kids to have 
such high suicide rates.</p>

<p>Judging by the grammar and spelling of some of the parents here 
supporting Youngkin’s regressive policies shows just how badly we need 
real educators making decisions for our children’s education. If you 
want to be bigoted, homeschool your kids or put them in a private 
school. Public education should be for all students and should make all 
students feel welcome and included. The hysteria of trans kids is just 
another distraction of the Republicans because they don’t actually know 
how to govern. Trans kids exist whether you want to admit it or not and 
these teachers and principals are not wasting their few minutes of free 
time to indoctrinate or groom your kids into gender affirming surgery 
(looking at you, Bob Good). Just leave these poor kids alone. Either 
support them or just ignore them. There is no need to pile on the 
already huge amount of stress these children are experiencing. Have some
 compassion.</p>

<p>I'm apalled at the so called adults who are so afraid of allowing 
people to be different from themselves- trans children deserve to be 
respected and protected. Non-binary students deserve the respect of 
their stated pronouns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed policy does harm and is a form of sanctioned bullying that is actually harmful and potentially deadly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public schools must be safe for every student.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I deeply oppose these changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't do this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>according to all good medical research in this field allowing 
children to explore their gender identity under the supervision of 
medical &amp; pyschiatric professionals is associated with a enormous 
drop in suicidality and positive effect on their mental health &amp; 
career prospects. at the same time policies like this drum up anti LGBT 
rhetoric and gives tacit approval to those seeking to dehumanize and 
harm children who are simply trying to be themselves. these changes will
 lead to the suffering and deaths of many virginian&nbsp; children and I
 urge the governor and his team to withdraw these changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is an absolutely monstrous policy that will lead to the deaths 
of so many children. You people claim to be pro life and anti-government
 over reach, and yet you want to enact policies that will lead to direct
 harm to children. They're already struggling enough as it is, but your 
twisted ideals lead you to want to hurt anyone who you deem different 
from yourself. You don't want to try to understand what these kids are 
going through, you just want to protect your shallow world view and tamp
 down anything that doesn't fit within it, regardless of who it hurts or
 how many kids will commit suicide over their treatment. It's disgusting
 and despicable. It makes me ashamed that I live in a state, a country, 
and a world that is so afraid of the other, they would rather out these 
kids and get rid of them than help them. Everyone who agrees with this 
policy or is trying to enact it should take a step back and realize what
 they're doing. Every kid that this hurts, every life that is taken, the
 blood is on your hands. I can't even come up with the words for how 
vile policies like this are.</p>

<p>I vehemently oppose this policy. Kids are not political pawns. This 
blatantly biased policy is a distraction from what a terrible job our 
governor is doing. This policy &nbsp;is meant to pit parents, teachers, 
and students against each other - similar to the teacher complaint line.
 While the teacher tip line disheartened teachers and led to 
resignations, this policy would harm the mental health of kids and put 
teachers in an impossible situation. Youngkin’s attempts to destroy 
Virginia’s public education system are transparent. The VA DOE should be
 independent from political tides and support all learners.</p>

<p>There is too much specificity on pronouns in this model guideline. I 
would like to see more information on grammar, and how the 
administration plans to support teachers &amp; students in improving 
their reading comprehension. Gerunds were&nbsp;really hard to learn in 
middle school, I don’t think we need to place so much effort into 
pronouns when there are harder concepts to learn. Sentence fragments are
 hard too, maybe include some more discussion on those. If the 
administration is not providing schools with the tools to educate our 
students, then they shouldn’t be implementing such strict protocols on 
pronouns and names.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you Governor Youngkin for protecting our children by giving 
their parents the right to make decisions for them. This bill is not 
about taking rights of transgender children and adolescents away, but 
simply allowing parents to be a part of their journey rather than 
keeping them at a distance. I fully support any child or adolescent who 
is struggling with mental illness, such as gender disphoria, as should 
any good teacher but a teacher is just that, a teacher. An individual 
placed in a child's life to teach him or her reading, math, science and 
social studies <em>not</em> family values. Thank you so much for putting
 this policy in writing - reminding our voters that it is the job of a 
parent to instill the values in their children, not a government paid 
employee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy will lead to more trans kids committing suicide. Are you

<p>It is past time to give parents full control. The schools need to 
stick to teaching reading and math. These are the skills that need to be
 improved. Let the activism and formation of beliefs to the parents who 
raise the kids.</p>

          <strong>Strongly OPPOSE New Model Policies</strong>
        </div>
        <div style="clear: right">&nbsp;</div>

        
        <div class="divComment">
          




<p dir="ltr">I am a representative of the Waynesboro High School 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee, a group of educators 
dedicated to making the school a safe and welcoming environment for 
students of historically-marginalized backgrounds. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I would like to raise <strong>serious concerns</strong> regarding these model policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">At WHS, there are approximately 90 transgender and 
gender-expansive students. These policies would directly negatively 
impact their daily lives by denying them the ability to safely express 
themselves and be affirmed for who they are. These students are 
deserving of protection and support.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The suicide rate for transgender youth is already extremely high.</strong>
 52% of trans youth seriously considered suicide, while 21% attempted 
suicide in the past year. This problem is preventable, but the new model
 policies would exacerbate the issue by denying students life-saving 
social transitions at school. The Trevor Project explains that 
“transgender and nonbinary youth who reported having pronouns respected 
by all or most people in their lives attempted suicide at half the rate 
of those who did not have their pronouns respected.” This statistic 
shows that<strong> honoring students’ chosen names and pronouns is a crucial form of suicide prevention.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moreover, as much as we would like to imagine that all 
parents are supportive of their children no matter their gender 
identity, educators see that this is unfortunately not the case: <strong>Transgender
 youth are at a higher risk of experiencing homelessness, in part 
because they are often kicked out of their homes or abandoned by 
caregivers due to their trans identity.</strong> The Trevor Project 
states that “38% of transgender girls/women, 39% of transgender 
boys/men, and 35% of nonbinary youth reported housing instability and 
homelessness.” <strong>By requiring educators such as teachers and 
guidance counselors to automatically inform parents of their child’s 
transgender identity if the student comes out at school, the state puts 
young people in a position where they must either suppress their 
identities entirely or risk the roof over their heads.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In summary, <strong>these new policies would in reality deny students the privacy, dignity, and respect they deserve</strong>.
 Schools have an important role in supporting the mental health and 
safety of their transgender and nonbinary students. As an educator 
dedicated to creating learning environments where everyone can thrive,<strong> I urge you to reject or at the very least substantially revise these model policies to protect trans youth.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Sincerely,</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lorraine Dresch, Waynesboro High School Teacher</p>

<p>If there is one social issue that must be stopped and regulated it is
 the gender transitioning of children. This trans-mania is being 
perpetuated on social media at a rapid pace and with schools echoing 
this nonsense out children don’t stand a chance. Thank you for standing 
for mental health and the advocacy of children and parents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The "MODEL" policy is a wolf in sheep's clothing. As a parent I 
understand that we have the right to decide how our children are reared.
 However we do not have the right to strip another human being (even if 
they're under 18 and came from us) of their humanity, and of their 
dignity. Requiring schools, specifically COUNSELORS to inform parents of
 ongoing gender related issues goes against a counselor's ethical 
standards to keep private matters private. Please do NOT target people 
who are struggling to find out who they are!!!!!</p>

<p>While what is written sounds "good" on paper, it is essentially still
 allowing one perspective or set of personal beliefs to dominate and 
restricts other perspectives and beliefs. Who says that there is only 
the sex assigned at birth and that only those pronouns or names should 
be used? If you respond with God, the bible, or anything like that, you 
are discriminating based on religious grounds. If you say biology, then 
you are not reading current literature on this issue. These policies 
will lead to discrimination, further bullying (by teachers no less, who 
can refuse to use preferred pronouns or names), and psychological and 
emotional harm to the children affected. I do not support this guidance 
and hope that legislators and educators refuse to support it, as 
well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Protect the rights of trans students! They must be treated with 
respect in school in order to have a safe and productive learning 
environment. They have a right to go by their preferred pronouns. The 
governor is bullying them for his own political gain, when they actually
 need to be supported and protected.</p>

<p>I was discouraged to see Gov Youngkin announcing the changes against 
trans children. Many were conned by this man into believing he would be a
 moderate governor but only voting for a person because of the R is now 
having repercussions. Taking away rights from our children is not what 
the majority of Virginians want. I'm an old hippie grandmother but I 
support all children having the right to be who they know inside. DO NOT
 PASS THIS LAW!</p>

<p>I strongly oppose Youngkin's draft model, which is rooted in 
transphobia. As a clergy person in Virginia, I see how policies like 
this impact kids and cause direct harm. Our educators are incredible and
 want to see kids thrive. This proposed policy does the opposite of 
that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This will not help the safety or mental health of Virginia's 
transgendered students. This reduces the American plurality of cultures 
and beliefs, running contrary to the melting pot that we are. Do not 
implement these harmful changes.</p>
<p>Please let the transgendered students know that they have more 
friends than the know, and if they have a family that would rather 
abscond from their duties as parents than accept their children for who 
they are, please know there are avenues to turn to other than self-harm,
 such as the Powers Safe Place in Front Royal.</p>

Germans go after in the 1930s and 1940s? Gay, trans, etc. Just more of 
the same moralistic sheen on a fascist movement. Maybe it works 
politically, maybe it doesn't, scaring parents, but in any case it's 
deeply evil. America will again defeat fascism, and those who pushed it 
in America will go down on the wrong side of the history books, that 
will be written, that will be in our libraries, that will be taught and 
read. You're either with the fascist or against them. Pretty clear in 
this case which side Gov. Youngkin and his extremists are on. Watch the

<p>Support parents as being in charge of raising their children. 
&nbsp;The current policy omits parents role in their children’s

<p>Parents should be involved and informed. Parents not schools are most</p>
<p>aware and capable of supporting their students. Long after schools are out of a childs life&nbsp;</p>
<p>parents will still be there to support their child. They must be included in decisions!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this policy. Trans and LQBTQ students deserve the 
opportunity to learn in a safe and inclusive environment. It does not 
harm other students to allows trans kids to use bathrooms of their 
choice and to use the pronouns that they choose. Not all parents are 
supportive and there is a reason some trans kids aren’t out at home. 
Forcing schools to out trans kids is incredibly dangerous and will have 
monstrous consequences. This policy is shameful and not based on 
evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Hi
 I'm eighteen and I'm in high school. I believe that students should 
have a right to identify as whatever gender they want to, but if they 
want to take meds or shots for <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>THEN</em></span></strong>
 it should be up to the parents. Some peoples parents are homophobic and
 it could ruin a child's relationship with their parents if they knew 
about how the child identifies. If it doesn't affect the child's well 
being then why not just call them a different name or pronoun, they're 
just words for christ's sake. I believe that we should just get over all
 this homophobic crap because it's hurting our kids, a lot of them are 
already insecure about their sexual identity so why are we making their 
insecurities worse? I know that we're trying to do the best for our 
kids, but this is wrong. I vote that they should choose for themselves, 
again unless it involves meds or shots for things like testosterone, 
because that can be dangerous it should be up to the parents. Thank you 
for hearing my input I appreciate it.</span></p>

<p>This policy change will kill children. This isn't melodramatic 
hyperbole. Policies like these proposed changes, when implemented in 
other states, have led to higher suicide rates among trans kids. But 
this is the price Republicans will pay to rally their base — the lives 
of other people's kids.</p>
<p>If this policy is implemented I will work to remove every GOP politician from office in Virginia.</p>

<p>As a long-time Virginia resident, I strongly oppose telling children 
they cannot be who they&nbsp;are or discuss their true selves in what 
should be a safe space: their classrooms with peers and teachers.</p>
<p>I know the quiet pain and fear of not being accepted - or even being 
bullied - that my LGBTQ+ friends and family lived with more than 25 
years ago. My hope was this would change over time to encourage 
acceptance of&nbsp;<strong>ALL</strong>&nbsp;students being who they are
 in the fullest sense. I have seen great progress since then but this is
 a massive step back and it disappoints me to my core.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Youngkin</strong>: As Governor of an entire state, you have a responsibility to govern for&nbsp;<strong>ALL</strong>
 Virginians, whether they voted for you or not. This is not limited to 
only the people who share your personal views - or to benefit your 
long-term political goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please consider that a year into your role as Governor, your aim 
should be to support Virginians, not to make vulnerable communities and 
young students feel more marginalized. These hurtful proposed policies 
could have serious negative impacts on young&nbsp;children for years to 
come. The long-term effects of not feeling accepted as who you are 
during a vulnerable time in your life will not go away in the 
short-term.</p>

<p>Schools protect kids in many ways. They offer the hungry food. They 
are a conduit to Family Services for kids who abused, unhoused and/or in
 need of help. School counselors, teachers and staff are resources for 
kids. They are places of safety and acceptance. What the Governor is 
proposing goes against everything we know about what is best for the 
kids. Let him leave practice his religion in his church, not in our 
schools.</p>

<p>I am a parent of a young child and a concerned community 
member.&nbsp; Trans and gender diverse children deserve our love and 
protection like all other children, and Gov. Youngkin's proposed policy 
will actively harm these children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my pro bono volunteer experience helping trans and gender diverse 
individuals change their name and gender markers on legal documents, I 
have seen firsthand how gender-affirming care and services can 
absolutely change peoples' lives and allow them to live with 
dignity.&nbsp; There is no reason to deny gender-affirming support to 
children, and such a denial will result in serious developmental and 
psychological harm to these children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before accepting the proposed policy, I urge you to speak to children
 and the parents of trans and gender diverse children who would be 
affected by this policy, and hear their stories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I strongly OPPOSE the draft policy and ask that the VDOE reject the policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you! lets bring common sense back and keep indoctrination and 
gender craziness out of our schools. Respect all genders - but dont 
influence our kids in schools into this gender idealogy. This is a fad -
 and will disappear soon. Keep kids safe, keep girls spaces safe, keep 
girls sports safe. Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a parent of two public school children in Virginia I strongly 
oppose this Bill and all efforts to demonize any of our neighbors for 
the Governors political ambitions. The idea that teachers or schools 
contribute to a person's gender or sexuality is absurd. Our teachers are
 here to support our students no matter what their strengths or 
weaknesses and regardless of gender and/or race. Government needs to 
focus on getting more resources into our schools and 
communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Youngkin and his education team are out of touch and Tess trans 
policies are a step back that expose kids to discrimination and 
bullying. &nbsp;But, clearly an Administration that hates the word 
equity wants that for innocent kids.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this discriminatory policy and its significant 
effects on mental health for these students. &nbsp;It is also completely
 hypocritical to base the decision on parent choice when you are 
ignoring the choice of parents who are very concerned with 
discrimination against their children and want policies to protect their
 children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy will result in the death of children, it is evil at its 
core, and it is clear to most people this is a ploy on Youngkin's part 
to pander to his base. It has no legal standing and will simply terrify 
families of gender diverse kids, lock schools and resources into 
litigation to defeat it. It's political pandering at the expense of our 
most precious and vulnerable population.</p>

<p>Every parent hopes our laws will ensure our children’s safety, 
protection, and freedom. But the Virginia Department of Education is 
rejecting those values and advancing a policy that would target trans 
and non-binary kids for bullying and mistreatment just because of who 
they are.</p>
<p>The proposed policies seek to erase trans and non-binary youth from 
the classroom and create a hostile and even dangerous school 
environment. They restrict restroom access and sports participation for 
transgender and nonbinary students, require faculty and staff to “out” 
trans and nonbinary students to their parents, and prohibit teachers and
 staff from supporting trans students in a range of ways, including 
blocking them from using a student’s affirming name and pronouns.</p>
<p>The effect can be devastating to these youth -- not only increasing 
the incidence of bullying, but increasing depressions and other mental 
health issues and possibly even suicide.</p>
<p>Hate does not belong in Virginia schools – and trans and non-binary 
students deserve the safety to thrive, no matter where they are.</p>
<p>This Proposed Policy needs to be rescinded.</p>

<p>I have 2 kids in public school in Virginia, and trans affirming 
school policy matters to me. This is why I oppose the draft policy and 
urge the VDOE to reject them. My kids have a transgender friend, and 
their friend deserves to feel safe and attend school in an inclusive 
environment for all students. Their parents should not have to worry 
about whether or not they will need to leave the state of Virginia in 
order to find a safe environment for their at risk child. Let's not 
forget these are CHILDREN we are talking about, and they deserve loving 
support from the adults around them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this proposal. It is damaging to children. The 
proposal itself has stoked fear and confusion for both the children 
affected and their families. It seeks to divide, not support our 
communities. It reeks of political grandstanding at the expense of our 
most vulnerable youth.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>The announcement that the original proposal will go into effect at 
the end of the 30 day period suggests this comment period is merely 
theater and is mocking our democratic process and good governance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stop trying to interfere with progress. This is a dangerous bill.

<p>All of the research points to a need to be inclusive and support 
transgender students. The world is not binary. The world is changing. 
Have you talked to any youth lately? They are pushing back against the 
patriarchy in ways that are threatening I guess to the Republican Party 
to the status quo, but they are identifying themselves that is 
consistent to who they are. If parents do not know who their child is, 
that is a different problem that does not require legislation. Get to 
know your children.&nbsp; Trust research which shows how best to protect
 transgender people, but especially youth. Learn to be open minded and 
empathetic. Be kind. All of the cliches apply. The only thing this 
policy will do is to harm children. It seems like another thoughtless 
political ploy from the Republican Party playbook.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The proposed policies will purposefully create a hostile and 
dangerous school environment for trans and non-binary youth. They 
restrict restroom access and sports participation for transgender and 
nonbinary students, require faculty and staff to “out” trans and 
nonbinary students to their parents, and prohibit teachers and staff 
from supporting trans students in a range of ways, including blocking 
them from using a student’s affirming name and pronouns. How filled with
 hate do you have to be to do this?</p>

<p>I am so angry about this movement towards making Trans kids feel less
 than.&nbsp; I am angry about Youngkin trying to out them, trying to 
control them, and trying to put some religious spin onto the 
situation.&nbsp; Just because you can't imagine what it must be like to 
feel incomplete doesn't mean you get to legislate LGBQT+ students.&nbsp;
 They are just kids. They are just trying to get through life and you 
making them feel less than is horrible. We will fight you on this.&nbsp;
 Everyone - KIDS INCLUDED - deserve the same rights as everyone else. 
That means right to privacy.&nbsp; I know that Youngkin wants to be like
 Iran and have morality police but we will not stand for it.&nbsp; My 
kid may be graduating soon but my votes, my money, and my fight will 
always go towards supporting ALL kids.&nbsp; I do not support anything 
that takes rights away. I do not support anything that brings hate 
against LGBQT+ kids. I do not support any politician who supports 
Youngkin and these backward policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let me begin by saying that I am an openly gay mother of several 
openly gay children that I would give my last breath for. I have been 
very active in their school life since 2009 when my oldest began 
kindergarten in Spotsylvania. I have not always agreed with things that 
have happened in their schools, eg; taking away Spanish as an elective, 
using the taking away of playground time as a form of punishment, to 
name a few, but I stand by the staff at my children’s schools because I 
come from a long line of teachers myself and I have seen first hand the 
love and dedication it takes to be an educator.&nbsp;<br>That being 
said, those educators are not my children’s parents, I am. &nbsp;Those 
teachers are not their healthcare providers, the medical teams I have 
carefully selected over 19 years and have been charged with giving the 
level of care my children need, are. They are also not the therapists or
 psychiatrists in charge of my children’s mental health, again, the team
 I selected and they agree to, are. If there is an issue I need to be 
made aware of, especially when the consequences of keeping it a secret 
could be life altering, it is my right as a parent to know so that I can
 go to the medical teams and address it with the appropriate authorities
 so my children can receive the care they need.&nbsp;<br>While I 
understand not every parent is as understanding and loving as myself and
 my husband, I still believe it is the parents right and the schools 
obligation to inform parents &nbsp;of concerns involving their children,
 from poor grades, bullying, to medical concerns. I also understand that
 there are concerns of potential abuse stemming from “outing” a child, I
 take them seriously as we all should, but school administrators, 
teachers, and guidance staff are all trained court mandated reporters. 
This means the door will open for getting children out of homes that are
 dangerous for them.&nbsp;<br>As Virginians we should be concerned for a
 movement that seeks to keep parents for being involved in their 
children’s lives, especially considering how some counties have covered 
up sexual assaults or other issues like riots and large scale fights 
among other things. Where does it stop? When do parental rights end and 
those of the educational system begin?</p>

<p>All children deserve a safe learning environment and having teachers 
and administrators concerning themselves with the genitalia of the 
children is sick. Respecting children's personal autonomy is a huge part
 of helping them grow into great adults. This has nothin to do with 
religious beliefs being violated and everything to do with fear of the 
unknown. The welfare of the child should come before the personal 
beliefs of a single ff. This policy will foster a hostile environment 
for trans and non-binary children making it impossible to learn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Students are NOT solely the property of their parents and do have 
rights granted to them that Virginia is attempting to ignore. It is NOT 
the responsibility of schools to out queer students to parents; if 
parents have put any work into their relationship with their children, 
than they would know already if their child wants to use different 
names. The parents who applaud this expect the school to take over their
 parental responsibility to build a relationship with their kids. 
Furthermore, if most who want this policy actually spent time in school 
activities with their kids, they’d find out very quickly what their 
child is going by and their child’s thoughts. This is the government 
overreaching into schools for parents too lazy to actually parent their 
child and create a loving environment at home for their own 
children.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>It will also place undue burden on teachers and open the schools for 
liability when a name is forgotten to be passed on or a parent accuses 
an unknowing teacher of hiding a name that the kid told their friends, 
but never explicitly told the teacher.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>For the kids who will be outed to unsupportive or bigoted parents, 
the results can end in death, homelessness, and physical or emotional 
abuse. Studies show repeatedly that queer kids&nbsp;<strong>are not 
inherently more likely to be suicidal than their peers EXCEPT when faced
 with unsupportive family or school environments. Per the Trevor Project
 and the UCLA and Williamson Center, students in supportive environments
 fair significantly better than students who are forced into unsafe and 
unsupportive environments.&nbsp;</strong><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Stop using children and public education as pawns in your political games. Stop trying to damage public education.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Children of all races and genders no matter how they identify have 
the right to go to school and not feel afraid to be who they are. 
Everyone has that right under the constitution. &nbsp; Anyone who 
supports this action is cruel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This "model" policy is discrimination. Students deserve to be

safe space for students. This policy is dehumanizing and 
disgraceful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Youngkin's proposed policy is not merely wrong, it is despicable</p>
<p>First, the proposed policy is probably illegal and is simply a political stunt that diverts attention from serious matters.</p>
<p>More important, all children are susceptible to bullying and trans 
children are even more vulnerable. They should not be subjected to 
emotional and physical bullying over bathroom use.</p>
<p>The policy would force trans children into more progressive private schools which are not affordable to all.</p>
<p>The proposed policy is totally inconsistent with the values and 
wishes of Fairfax families which are expressed in our current policies.</p>
<p>in addition to legal challenges the proposed policies must be rejected by the people of Fairfax,</p>

<p>Please do not weaponize public schools to target vulnerable 
children.&nbsp; This is a political solution in search of a problem, not
 a way to actually help Virginians.&nbsp; Trans kids are already at 
increased risk of suicide, why on earth would you bring the power of the
 state to contribute to the bullying?&nbsp; Disgusting.</p>

          <strong>An act of violence towards the trans community</strong>

<p>This is an act of violence for political gain for some small subset 
of Virginia voters. People thought in 2021 that they had two moderate 
candidates, that because Glenn wore a sweater vest that they made him 
"nice" and "moderate."</p>
<p>I have shared on Reddit and I will say today. This is an extreme act 
of war from a vest-wearing governor who is leading Virginia into dark 
territory.</p>
<p>Let this entire executive action be a lesson to ALL of those "swing 
voters" who went for Glenn last year, only for him to continue wading 
into a deeper cesspool of far-right policies.</p>
<p>This is where democracy goes to die. Little regard for civil rights, a
 disdain of intellectualism, and an Executive who is leading a wave of 
actions towards a community that struggles with being accepted in the 
United States by such actions as this.</p>
<p>Never again we will we forget this and the various other alt-right 
acts that the Republican Governor continues to focus on, hurting the 
trans community, and in the end of the day, basically promoting violence
 towards a community that needs lifted up -- not trampled on.</p>

<p>Policies like these proposed changes, when implemented in other 
states, have led to higher suicide rates among trans kids. As a licensed
 professional counselor with personal and professional experience 
working and relating to trans kids, gender affirming care improves their
 quality of life and protects against psychological trauma and 
developmental challenges. There is, absolutely no data to support the 
idea that gender affirming care harms anyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am a mom of a trans young adult. These kids need MORE support, not

higher in the trans youth population. They need help, love, support, 
acceptance. Wake up, Governor</p>

<p>These policies are rooted in transphobia and seeks to further harm 
trans and nonbinary kids. Forcing children to out themselves to 
non-supportive parents will harm children.&nbsp; Forcing parents and 
children to make legal decisions while a child is still developing and 
growing will harm families. Respecting every individual is not hard to 
do and can be accomplished with the original model policies that the 
General Assembly and the last administration put together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The actual studies around transgender/non-binary school policies does
 not support the bathroom and sports policies that this administration 
is proposing.&nbsp; These policies prohibit access and/or participation 
in activities consistent with their gender identity without real 
evidence that any other children are harmed by inclusion.</p>
<p>Hiding transphobia and hatred of what is different from what you 
consider the norm behind some vague notion of parental choice is 
absurd.&nbsp; These policies are an intrusion into families' choices, 
not a support for each parent making choices for how they raise their 
children.&nbsp; It is laughable to call these supportive of parental 
choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I implore the Board of Education to reject these reject these 
policies as they are fueled by hatred and do the exact opposite of what 
they claim to do--they restrict parents choices on how to raise their 
children and make it harder for teachers and faculty to support parental
 choice for parents of transgender and non-binary children.</p>

<p>I am a retired Virginia public school teacher (33years) and the 
mother of 2 daughters who graduated from Virginia public schools. 
&nbsp;There is no data that reflects the need for any of these new 
policies and restrictions. &nbsp;The fear and concern surrounding the 
acceptance and accommodation of LGBTQ students are based in fear, rather
 than any actual problems. &nbsp;I am very disappointed that politicians
 in Richmond are willing to use unfounded concerns and fears as a way to
 further their careers. &nbsp;Virginia Public Schools should be 
committed to honest, data-based policies. &nbsp;Furthering unfounded 
myths and fears is the absolute opposite of the ideals of education. 
&nbsp;Please support and protect ALL of Virginia’s school children. 
&nbsp;It is the right and principled way for Virginia &nbsp;is to face 
the future.</p>

<p>Trans children deserve the same safety and autonomy afforded to their
 cis peers. Trans youth face extremely high rates of suicide attempts 
because they already feel excluded, different, and unsafe in their own 
bodies, in their own homes. This policy will have a direct effect to 
make that WORSE for trans children in Virginia schools, make no doubt 
that if enacted this will be responsible for a higher rate of suicide 
among queer kids. Blood will be on your hands, Glenn.</p>
<p>Trans kids deserve better than this. They only want to be themselves and you're so <img src="VirginiaRegulatoryTownHallViewComments1_files/blackbox.gif" alt="black box" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: middle">ing
 threatened by that, you'd rather silence them into the grave. This is

          <strong>No Rollback on Transgender Students Rights</strong>
        </div>

<p>As a constituent of Charlottesville City, alum of Albemarle County 
Schools, sexual/domestic violence preventionist, and queer adult, I 
wholeheartedly disagree with the proposed changes to this policy. 
Transgender students deserve to be safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having one’s name and pronouns accepted is a well-researched method 
of lowering suicide risk in transgender youth (Bailey et al., 2014; 
Bauer et al., 2015a; Haas et al., 2011; SPRC, 2008).</p>
<p>Forcing staff to only use a students' legal name/deny them access to 
school bathrooms will negatively affect the mental health of both 
parties (the student, for being denied such a basic right as to be 
called what they want to be called, and the staff for being mandated to 
break trust with a student). The policy also creates pointless issues 
for non-transgender students - in my middle school class in Virginia, 
several students went by nicknames that had nothing to do with their 
legal names ("Carrie" went by "Morgan", Xiang Zhi went by "John"). This 
policy puts an undue burden of cost, time, and money on parents and 
youth to legally change the child's name in order for them to be 
identified appropriately on the day-to-day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Single-stall bathrooms are few and far between, especially in rural 
counties where all students might attend a single middle or high school;
 facilities such as stadiums and locker rooms; or campuses that are 
spread across multiple buildings. Policies that state transgender and 
nonbinary youth can only access single-stall bathrooms or else be forced
 to use bathrooms aligned with assigned sex is therefore an access 
issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mandating staff to out students to their parents puts youth at risk 
for abuse from unaffirming family members. The harm from this action can
 be anything from the guardians pulling the student from school 
counseling, to kicking them out of the home entirely, to physical abuse,
 suicide, or even murder of the child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children thrive when they feel safe in schools - all changes should be rejected.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 2022 Model 
Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and 
Parents in Virginia’s Public Schools. I am an English teacher at 
Waynesboro High School, and I participate in many school activities as a
 class co-sponsor and as a part of the theater department.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I would like to raise serious concerns regarding these model policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">At WHS, there are approximately 90 transgender and 
gender-expansive students. These policies would directly negatively 
impact their daily lives by denying them the ability to safely express 
themselves and be affirmed for who they are. These students are 
deserving of protection and support.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The suicide rate for transgender youth is already extremely
 high. 52% of trans youth seriously considered suicide, while 21% 
attempted suicide in the past year. This problem is preventable, but the
 new model policies would exacerbate the issue by denying students 
life-saving social transitions at school. The Trevor Project explains 
that “transgender and nonbinary youth who reported having pronouns 
respected by all or most people in their lives attempted suicide at half
 the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected.” This 
statistic shows that honoring students’ chosen names and pronouns is a 
crucial form of suicide prevention.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moreover, as much as we would like to imagine that all 
parents are supportive of their children no matter their gender 
identity, educators see that this is unfortunately not the case: 
Transgender youth are at a higher risk of experiencing homelessness, in 
part because they are often kicked out of their homes or abandoned by 
caregivers due to their trans identity. The Trevor Project states that 
“38% of transgender girls/women, 39% of transgender boys/men, and 35% of
 nonbinary youth reported housing instability and homelessness.” By 
requiring educators such as teachers and guidance counselors to 
automatically inform parents of their child’s transgender identity if 
the student comes out at school, the state puts young people in a 
position where they must either suppress their identities entirely or 
risk the roof over their heads.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In summary, these new policies would in reality deny 
students the privacy, dignity, and respect they deserve. Schools have an
 important role in supporting the mental health and safety of their 
transgender and nonbinary students. As an educator dedicated to creating
 learning environments where everyone can thrive, I urge you to 
substantially revise these model policies to protect trans youth.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sincerely,</p>

<p>As an adult trans woman I oppose this rule. I spent my teenage years 
suffering in silence, thinking nobody else could possibly understand, or
 that there was no way I would ever be accepted at school—and that was 
before there even were rules about this at the state level. I was 
unspeakably depressed, and it really only got worse as time went on and I
 continued developing without any intervention. I grew to hate my body 
and hate myself, all because I knew I could never reach my ideal. And 
reaching my ideal was the only option—otherwise I knew I would be 
rejected and abused by society.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem was not learning to accept this misery, 
learning to play this role I had been assigned without complaint. The 
solution was realizing that I had control over my own life, that I had a
 say in who I grew up to be. That is what trans kids need. They don’t 
need to be silenced and denied and shamed. They need to know that there 
is a chance for them to be who they want to be.</p>
<p>Reject this new rule. The 2021 guidance was the correct policy and should not be negated.</p>

<p>The model policy put in place in 2021 was extremely useful and very 
supportive of students and families. As a school professional who is 
connected with other school divisions around the state, I have heard of 
no true, verified problems created by this 2021 policy (only the 
solutions and protections it put in place.) To the degree that there are
 any real (not imagined or theoretical) issues raised by the 2021 model 
policy, then the next step would be to proposed very specific 
adjustments, not a wholesale roll-back.&nbsp;<br><br>During the 2021 
comment period, I reviewed the public comments. Among those who were 
afraid of supporting trans and non-binary students, all to many 
literally used phrases such as "bring back bullying." In proposing a 
reversal to the 2021 model policy, I am afraid that Virginia is 
listening to such fear-based, irrational, and hateful voices.</p>

<p>Both of my children at one point thought they might be trans. Their 
entire friend groups thought so too, and I noticed the contagion aspect 
of it all, so I just gave them the room to feel out the identity without
 any pressure to do something about it on my end. I approached it the 
same as I would have if they shared their interest in a new band or 
hobby. Low and behold, they both grew out of it. I'm lucky in regards to
 having close relationships with my children who feel comfortable enough
 to speak openly about things they are going through, but had they not 
had that, I can imagine them getting further caught up in going down a 
road that isn't actually who they are, because that's exactly what the 
schools are creating.</p>
<p>They've both told me of the pressures of being anything other that 
"cis" and "white." How it's the worst of the worst and schools have made
 them feel unworthy of their humanity due to their innate sexual 
nature/preference and their skin color. So, it's no wonder when one in a
 friend group says they're trans and the schools are constantly pumping 
out trans/queer talking points, the whole group starts experimenting 
with the label, as it's an easy way to escape the stigma of being an 
"oppressor." That's absolutely the environment being created in schools 
currently. </p>
<p>For what it's worth, up until all of this trans ideology started 
getting pushed, I had been a staunchly democratic voter. I just can not 
anymore with where the left is going. Seeing what I've now seen, I know 
if I was a teen currently, I'd be caught up in it all too. I was a 
tomboy that grew into a confident woman because no one cared that I was 
gender non-conforming and preferred playing with the boys. Were I in 
schools now, I'd be pressured and fast tracked into a trans identity 
because I guess we're going back to sexist stereotypes.</p>
<p>Thank you, Governor, and the entire administration who played a part 
in drafting these new guidelines. It's the absolute right move.</p>

<p>The revised policies now take into consideration the protection of 
all children and parental rights. These are two very important aspects 
that were not considered or deemed important by the previous 
administration. Thank you for upholding parental rights and for 
considering the safety of all children!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The policy released for transgender and non-binary students is 
extremely dangerous and cruel. Children know who they are, and as adults
 we should trust them to show their true selves. This policy absolutely 
does not protect children and parents’ rights. This protects bigots who 
are afraid of people different from them. When we don’t allow students 
to be their true selves, we risk their safety and mental health.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>As a teacher, currently on child rearing leave, I can assure you that
 students can only learn and thrive in a place where they feel safe, 
loved, and valued. Teachers must first ensure that Maslow’s Hierarchy of
 Needs are met so that children can learn. Part of this is ensuring a 
child’s safety. &nbsp;By forcing families to provide permission and 
documents to support their children, and forcing children to out 
themselves in potentially unsafe situations, you are doing the exact 
opposite of these things. Follow the research, which these policies are 
wrong on a human and educational level, and state law. Trans and 
non-binary students are valued and deserving of a space to learn where 
they can truly be themselves, without interference and permission from 
an adult.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>As a parent, if my children choose to use a different bathroom or 
pronouns they will be supported and loved. I expect the same from any 
classroom and school my child enters. This would not be the case, should
 these policies be in place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the father of a transgender child and also a former legislator, I ask that you reject these changes.</p>
<p>It is a matter of opinion and not of fact that "The 2021 Model 
Policies promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and 
social transformation in schools."&nbsp; While respectful, I was pretty 
ignorant of trans issues before my son came out. To that end, I think 
the most helpful thing to realize when reviewing these new guidelines is
 that a young adult is not "changing their gender", rather those around 
them have a new realization of their gender.&nbsp; That is, for a true 
trans child their gender has been the same all along, it is merely the 
adults perception that has changed. </p>
<p>I would also like to point out that this model policy doesn't 
separate schools and parents, it injects government into the life of 
parents and a child.&nbsp; Asking teachers to police nicknames is just 
silly and waste of time... Christopher, a male, now goes by Chris and 
has long hair. Maybe the child is transitioning. Government to the 
rescue! Call the parents!</p>
<p>Maybe next we should have teachers contact the parents if their kids 
are dating another child because it might be a violation of the parental
 rights that their child dates someone...</p>
<p>In fact the proper teacher response to a gay or trans child is: Are, 
are they "coming out"?!? Who cares! Do they have poor grades and seems 
depressed... that is when you care and reach out to a school 
counselor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many tricky issues around this topic but they involve 
permanent life decisions such as surgery. The school system won't be 
involved in these in any regard and the parent should have every 
traditional right over an unemancipated minor in these cases. Everything
 else is - names, dress, etc is transitory and not the government's 
business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This model is being used under the guise of parental rights.&nbsp; 
However, it is not about parental rights, but about transphobia and 
misinformation.&nbsp; If you are being an active parent, then your 
children will come to you.&nbsp; If you aren't, why are you only now 
taking a weird stance on being involved?&nbsp; Transphobia.&nbsp; There 
is not a single peer-reviewed study that suggests lack of support 
discourages a person from being trans.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; There are 
several that say a supportive environment curbs suicidal thoughts and 
lessen depression and anxiety.&nbsp; If you truly want schools to focus 
on reading, writing, math, and science, and only those things, then 
schools need to stop providing food, clothing, transportation, extra 
curricular activities that are not solely academic.&nbsp; None of those 
things fall under reading, writing, and arithmetic.&nbsp; Compassion is 
the bedrock for all religions (who seem to be the ones in support of 
this bigotry) and yet instead of trying to alleviate the pain in our 
neighbor's lives, we instead want to deny their existence and their 
right to exist.&nbsp; Your children are watching the way you are 
behaving and they see what you are saying about them, their friends, 
their cousins.&nbsp; You are doing way more damage to your parent-child 
relationship than this policy ever could.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I strongly 
oppose this policy and any similar policies that do not allow common 
courtesy and basic human respect for someone we may not 
understand.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Young kin’s proposed ban is another example
 of conservatives clawing back human rights in the name of… what 
exactly? Why does this administration want to promulgate fear and hatred
 towards&nbsp;<strong>children</strong>?&nbsp;All children deserve the 
freedom to express who they truly are, I dont want to see any other 
trans or queer children hurt or worse from the judgement and policing of
 people who have no understanding of their feelings and struggle. I 
strongly oppose this bill and will continue to fight it—this ban has no 
place in our schools. Youngkin, why dont you pick a school issue that 
hits closer to home (maybe like gun violence?).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new restrictions on transgender students in schools is horrible. 
As Macaulay Porter wrote in a statement: “It is not under a school’s or 
the government’s purview to impose a set of particular ideological 
beliefs on all students.” By not giving students the respect that all 
human beings deserve, you are imposing your own ideological beliefs on 
all students. It is incredibly harmful to not respect individuals enough
 to call them by their name and pronouns. Every death of a student if 
these policies go into place are because of Youngkin. If this was about 
respect of beliefs, then these policies would not exist. If a student 
prefers to be called by a certain name, it does not harm you to respect 
that.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">This
 policy was written without any basis of fact. It goes directly against 
all best practices when it comes to the wellbeing of our very vulnerable
 trans youth. Reading the “support” comments for this policy you can see
 that the people pushing this are ignorant of the daily struggle these 
students go through and are all to happy to push these kids into even 
more precarious situations because the existence of trans individuals 
ruins their concept the world. <br><br>However on the merits of this 
policy, it’s all garage, made by people who clearly did not seek the 
input from the affected communities. What has been proposed is a 
reactionary and cruel political stunt that will harm kids throughout the
 Commonwealth. If&nbsp; you were to consult with people that work in 
this field and you will find just how backwards and damaging these 
policies can be. Being trans, discussing the transgender community, and 
affirming trans people is not pollical it is empathy and this policy is 
quite devoid of that.<br><br>I WHOLHERATEDLY DISSAPROVE OF THIS POICY PROPOSAL!!!</p>

<p>As a parent of a young child attending Virginia public schools, I 
oppose this guidance. It is clear in reading the comments in support of 
this guidance that this "parents rights" or "parents choice" language is
 a guise. The guidance seems to me to seek to shame and delegitimize 
transgender and other nonbinary identities. Commenters in support of 
this guidance make claims around the physical and sexual safety of 
children - saying that to keep children safe from predatory behavior, 
this guidance must be approved. Commenters state that transgender or 
nonbinary identities are not scientifically or emotionally valid, that 
they don't exist and should not be recognized by society. This is what 
is at the heart of this bill, not parent involvement. No one on either 
side of this debate wants parents to be eliminated from important 
decisions and discussions related to their children. To suggest 
otherwise is a perfect example of gaslighting. Our current school system
 and guidance allows me, as a parent, to be as fully involved as I need 
and want to be in important decisions concerning my child. This bill is 
an attempt to push back on the visibility and dignity of transgender and
 nonbinary people. I don't approve of this.</p>

<p>There are several parts of this proposal that I'd like to go over. 
For one, forcefully outing kids to their parents is setting up some of 
them to be abused and murdered by relatives that don't understand or 
choose not to. Their suffering would be on you. Furthermore, not every 
kid who thinks they might be trans actually is, they could be just 
seeing how different styles or pronouns fit them in the safety of 
school. And by forcefully outing them, you might take away that 
experimentation, putting even cis kids in danger. Also, where is the 
line drawn? If a young cis girl isn't performing femininity to your 
standards, does she get "outed" as trans? Is she no longer allowed to 
use the bathroom that she feels most comfortable using? Is she kicked 
off of her sports teams? It doesn't make any sense, and is frankly just a
 disgusting way of controlling kids.</p>
<p>As for the restriction of using a preferred name, that also makes 
absolutely no sense. I remember so many kids asking to be called 
nicknames or something other than their legal names, and more often than
 not that made it easier on the teachers. Many kids asked to be called 
something else if someone shared their first name in the class. This 
proposal would completely take that possibility from them, leading to 
more issues. Then there's the fact that some people never even really go
 by their legal names. I knew someone who, from being a small child, 
they had a nickname and pretty much everyone called them by it. And none
 of that is even taking into account the fact that being called your 
deadname on a daily basis, hurts. It frankly should be avoided at all 
cost, or the person will just come to associate that name with terrible 
things. That's what happened with my deadname. My mom refuses to use my 
name, and I feel genuine hate towards that name instead of just thinking
 that it wasn't for me, like I used to.</p>
<p>Protect trans kids, protect cis kids, but those protections DO NOT 
have to come at the cost of the other. Actions like this will end in 
suffering and death for far too many children.</p>

<p>I fully support this updated policy; it is a correct, common sense 
approach solution for ALL parents and families and the state of 
Virginia. </p>
<p>The vilification of the MAJORITY of people who simply don’t want to 
be dictated to by political activists and special interest groups has 
got to stop and I applaud the Youngkin administration for taking 
decisive action to correct the atrocities that have been seeping into 
the fabric of our academic culture. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Get back to ACADEMICS and END this perverse overreach that propagates
 “fad” body dysmorphic disorders instead of actually helping kids who 
require individual support between parents and teachers. </p>
<p>Keep the indoctrination OUT of taxpayer funded schools!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>First let me say that I am strongly opposed to the new proposed Model
 Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public
 Schools that reverse current policy.&nbsp; As the mother of a 
transgender child, I believe it is NOT for the better of the child and 
panders to the insecurities of adults who cannot or will not take the 
time to understand what these children go through on a daily 
basis.&nbsp; You will be subjecting them to bullying and abuse by the 
very people that are supposed to be protecting them!&nbsp; Ignorance and
 fear have shaped this policy and it has no place in our Educational 
system.&nbsp; These children have a hard enough time coming to terms 
with who they are, they should not be made to live in fear.&nbsp; School
 should be a safe place for them to learn and grow, and if they seek 
counseling of their own accord, it should be kept confidential.&nbsp; 
They may be minors, but they have rights too!&nbsp; 
&nbsp;OPPOSED!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>This will harm more children than it helps. It is cloaked in language
 of parent choice and parental rights but that is a red herring. In 
cases where a family is supportive, this causes undue administrative 
burden to manage. In cases where a family is not supportive, this puts 
the child in danger.</p>

<p>Parents need to be involved in every aspect of their children's 
education.&nbsp; Teachers and school administrators have no right to 
start a process of gender transition which ultimately leads to 
sterilization without the knowledge of the parents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools 
need to educate children, not get involved with gender confusion.</p>

<p>It is not overstating things to say that this policy makes it more 
likely that trans kids in VA will resort to self-harm or suicide. To 
keep a kid alive through a vulnerable time, just one adult who sees them
 and supports them can make a huge difference. This guidance makes it 
harder for trans kids to feel safe at school. It basically condones 
bullying them, by misgendering them and deadnaming them, and it prevents
 trans kids for whom home may not be a safe place from feeling safe 
confiding in a trusted teacher. This policy is abusive to a population 
that's already vulnerable and at greater risk of suicide and self-harm 
than young people overall.</p>
<p>Virginia has a governor more interested in bolstering his 
conservative bonafides for a presidential run than keeping kids safe and
 alive. What a tragedy that is for vulnerable young people in VA.</p>

<p>I am strongly opposed to this proposal as it will unduly harm 
children. Forcing children to be outed and not respecting a child to be 
referred to as they wish is cruel and serves no value. Do not purport 
“safety” when you are in fact making children less safe.</p>

<p>Let kids be kids and teachers be teachers. This “guidance” sets up 
trans kids for bullying when they are unable to express and be who they 
are. If you are so concerned about who uses which bathroom or locker 
room, perhaps instead you should consider how schools are built and make
 all bathrooms with single stalls or single showers instead of the 
barbaric communal showers and urinals we have now. Then no one would 
know or care whether your genitals matched your gender. And have 
mandatory training for all about what transgender means and why that is a
 necessary choice for some people. Religion has no role in this and 
should not be used as an excuse for limiting children’s rights. 
Compassion and understanding, not fear and bullying, should be the goal 
of our schools.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Trans youth need our support and 
understanding. The Governor's proposed policies take us backwards to a 
dark place where our kids can't get the support they need from the 
people who are meant to be guiding them. Not being able to be recognized
 by your chosen name or your gender, is painful and uncomfortable.&nbsp;
 Teachers and staff should be able to support these kid's identities. 
Being transgender at school should not be a reportable item to parents, 
either. This puts being a transgender child into the realm of being a 
problem child, a misfit, or mentally ill.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Please, please do not adopt these harmful
 policies. Protect our kids and give them a safe place to learn. Protect
 their school allies choices to support them too.</p>

<p>Youngkins new policy proposal on the rights of transgender students 
is horrible. It hurts access to education and student safety. This is 
not a parents rights issue, it’s a human rights issue, and Youngkin and 
the rest of his party are on the wrong side of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have many words for you governor, but none of them are truly 
productive so I'll save them for another time. For now, I only have a 
few things to say, and I pray to whomever is up there that you'll 
listen. Your actions could have grave consequences. This is not an 
exaggeration. If you look into the rates of suicide in trans youth, 
you'll see how your actions impact people's lives. One of the most 
proven ways to protect our lives is by using the correct name and 
pronouns. Now, you're making it illegal for schools to do that. The 
blood of children is on your hands, and I hope you'll realize this</p>

<p>Governor Youngkin and VA Board of Education,</p>
<p>The 2022 Model policy released last week is a thinly veiled political
 move to supposedly protect parental rights and uphold the dignity and 
respect of all public school students.</p>
<p>I believe this is nothing but the Governor's personal desire to 
impose a set of ideological beliefs on all students. It is yet another 
cruel attempt on the part of the Youngkin administration to use these 
kids in their culture wars to score political points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Virginia and our kids deserve MUCH better. This policy is so misguided and flat out WRONG.</p>

<p>I oppose this policy revision. The Supreme Court upheld the right of 
trans students to use the restroom of their choice. We need to support 
these students and prevent discrimination. We need to support these 
students by using their names and pronouns and showing respect for them 
as people. Teachers/staff who have religious beliefs that tell them 
LGBTQ people are committing sins can hold those beliefs but not enforce 
them on others. Follow Jesus's command to love one another. Please 
protect our children from bigotry.</p>

<p>This guidance will not help parents make decisions for their

<div>Parents “rights” are not more important than our children’s lives. 
This policy will hurt kids. Transgender students are already a 
population with high risk factors. The 2022 policy is not based on 
evidence or research. In fact, the evidence and research 
runs&nbsp;contrary&nbsp;to the 2022 policy:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% 
reported suicidality. School belongingness mitigates these risks and is a
 significant predictor variable for reducing suicidal ideation and 
attempts among transgender youth (Austin et al., 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transgender and nonbinary youth whose schools prevent them from using
 the restrooms/locker rooms that best matched their gender identities 
were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted, 26% for 
transgender males and&nbsp;149% for transgender females (Murchison et 
al., 2019).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted 
suicide in the past year. In fact, when pronouns are respected, 
transgender youth attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did 
not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project, 2020).</p>

<p>I, as a parent of school aged children and a Virginia resident, am 
extremely opposed. This is not about parental choice. Rather it is an 
attack on children as individuals entitled to express their true selves 
in a safe environment. We need to respect each child as a person and 
give them a supportive place to be who they are. Not every child is 
lucky to live with supportive family members/caregivers. The very least 
we can do is give them a safe and welcoming place in our public schools 
where they are seen for who they are - that includes their chosen names,
 pronouns, and expression of their gender identity. I absolutely have 
rights (and responsibilities) as a parent - but they do not supersede my
 childrens’ rights as people nor the schools’ responsibility to respect 
those rights.</p>

<p>There really shouldn't be anything that schools, school systems, or 
individual teachers are legally able to hide from a child's parents, 
other than information that should be handled by law enforcement.</p>

<p>trampling trans kids freedoms to be and identify as themselves in the
 guise of religious morality represents everything wrong with our 
country. protection of parent's "right" to discriminate and teach their 
kids to discriminate i would expect to find in florida or texas, not

<p>I’m a young trans kid and this policy is straight up bullying. I 
would expect this behavior from some of my peers but not from the 
governor of Virginia. These policies are hateful and unnecessary. Why 
does it matter what name and pronouns I use at school? What’s so scary 
about me using He/Him pronouns and the name Matteo. How am I a threat? 
I’m extremely lucky to have accepting parents, but even then these 
policies affect me. I have to go get a legal document saying I can use 
my preferred name and pronouns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The submitted new policies (2022) return our education system to the 
1960's or earlier. Virginia needs to move into the 21st C and 
politicians need to educate themselves on child development, 
psychological advancements, and most of all be concerned for the welfare
 of our children. Not all families are as portrayed in sitcoms of the 
50's and 60's, not all homes are safe. All are created in the image of 
God. Vote no for this new policy restricting that image.</p>

<p>I have a trans student this year. As a third grade teacher, I don’t 
expect to have many trans kids, but I know that kids start identifying 
with gender as early as the age of 3. It is my job to make all students 
feel safe and included in the classroom. If they aren’t feeling 
included, they won’t learn. Simple as that. I think this executive 
action by the governor is disgusting, goes against anti discrimination 
laws, and will not only keep trans kids from learning but will affect 
their mental health in a detrimental way. Teachers MUST affirm their 
trans students, say their chosen names, and use their preferred 
pronouns. This action by the governor isn’t about giving parents more 
rights over their child’s education. It’s about discriminating against 
trans students in the place where they spend the majority of their 
day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rather than changing public policy due to I’ll-informed and misguided

have a lot to deal with, and we should do what we can to ease their

<p>The governor’s new guidance on how to treat LGBTQIA+ and specifically
 Trans children in schools is cowardly, and does not address any actual 
problems or barriers that directly affect lives of children and those 
who work hard every day to keep them safe. Make VA a great state for ALL
 people, ALL lovers, ALL children, all WORKERS, and NOT by limiting the 
rights of some to appease the dollars and cents of the few who backed 
you, Youngkin.</p>

<p>I oppose the legislation that abolishes the trans-student rights 
established last year. These protections for trans-students create a 
safe learning environment for students, which is a basic right. 
Trans-students are no different than any other student, and should be 
treated with the same respect and equalities as all humans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Republicans seem so concerned about children, but only until they're 
out of the womb. Then it's 'parents' rights' while exposing trans kids 
to even more danger. Youngkin's lackluster, fear-based pandering 
policies are unacceptable.</p>

<p>Liberty for one requires liberty for all. This is selling out 
innocent children because a certain group of people feel mildly 
uncomfortable at having to make small accommodations to treat others as 
equals. This places an undue burden on a minority group just because 
those in power would rather harm them than deal with their own inner 
issues. It's absurd and hypocritical, and those pushing this policy 
wouldn't stand for it if the roles were reversed.</p>

<p>The proposed changes to this policy would deeply harm trans children.
 These policy changes may forcibly out a child and put them at risk of 
further harm and harassment. Every person deserves to be addressed by 
the name and pronouns of their choosing. Gov Youngkin’s proposal takes 
power away from the student and the teacher — keeping them from 
providing a safe and supporting environment to ALL of their students. I 
strongly oppose the proposed policy changes.</p>

<p>I fully support these model policies because the trans movement has 
obliterated reality right along with the rights of parents, and the 
rights to privacy and fairness for women and girls. Children are being 
lured into the false belief that they can change their biological 
makeup, and instead of giving children the support they need to deal 
with reality and help them through the emotional turmoil they are 
experiencing, schools and even doctors are encouraging this lie and 
destroying lives in the process. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is 
being forced to play along with this insanity. It’s well past time we 
put an end to this movement that is destroying families, putting girls 
in danger, and taking the hard fought fairness in women’s sports and 
throwing it out the window. No one has the right to hide information 
from the parents of a child, and no male should have the right to be in 
women’s private spaces or compete against females in girls and women’s 
sports. Enough with the trans insanity!!</p>

<p>The proposed policies are cruel, abhorrent, and unconstitutional in 
singling out vulnerable minorities for persecution. Kids have enough to 
deal with in the complex process of growing up, why go out of your way 
to make them more miserable? Are we next going to start policing kids’ 
diets, saying that kids with allergies aren’t fully capable of 
participating in schools or that they should be forced to eat school 
lunches designed for kids without their needs? Or demanding their 
parents be told when a kid chooses not to eat their vegetables?&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>Our government was set up to protect the powerless and give voice to 
the vulnerable. Trans kids, queer kids, kids figuring themselves out — 
these are the definition of vulnerable and exactly who we should be 
working to shield from hatred and intolerance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These policies will end up killing kids. Kids are required to go to 
school because parents don’t equal good treatment. Every kid that ends 
up being abused and kicked out, and any kid that commits suicide, is 
because of Youngkin and his policies. He was elected by a few but should
 be creating policy for all. These kids are too young to vote, so we 
must protect them. Youngkin should be representing everyone, not just 
straight Christians. Do not enact these policies!</p>

<p>I fully support the proposed 2022 Guidelines. &nbsp;The 2021 Guidance
 put schools in the position of severing the parent-child relationship, 
of deciding what is best for a child and of unduly influencing a minor 
child. &nbsp;While supportive schools are essential, and the rights of 
every student are equally important, parents know, love and care for 
their children far more than schools, which are transient in a child's 
life. &nbsp;The previous 2021 guidance went far beyond State and Federal
 Law in wresting decision-making and authority away from parents and 
handing it over to schools and non-guardians. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This new guidance appropriately revokes the deceit authorized by the 
2021 guidance, which in practice directed schools to conceal its 
interactions with a minor child, whether over counseling or use of 
pronouns, facilities etc. This deceitful aspect of the 2021 guidance was
 one of its most problematic and dangerous features.</p>
<p>The previous guidance put girls and women in harm's way by allowing 
males into all their safe spaces. &nbsp;While the intent of the 2021 
guidance is to allow transgender students to chose facilities, the 
practice in the way it is worded disallows questioning of any male 
entering a female space. &nbsp;Further, the population of girls and 
women who have been victims of sexual assault is far greater than the 
population of transgender students, and it is wrong and dangerous for 
these women to have to fear males entering private spaces with them. 
There are reasonable and fair ways to protect transgender students 
without taking away the right to privacy and safety of every female in 
the system.</p>
<p>Further, the former guidance unlawfully compelled speech as to 
pronoun usage, again going far beyond both State and federal law. 
&nbsp;Every child deserves equal respect, but the law does not grant 
them the right to compel the speech of others.</p>
<p>Every school will have to work out ways to respect and support 
transgender children, including for children who may face danger at 
home. It goes without question that support, compassion and respect are 
essential to caring for transgender children in schools. The answer, 
however, is not a blanket order affecting all families by unlawfully 
removing parental authority and involvement from a child's life, as was 
the effect of the previous guidance. &nbsp;Schools and counselors should
 be partners with children and parents, not usurpers of parental roles.</p>
<p>This policy is a great step forward in removing the excesses of the 2021 Guidance.</p>
<p>I borrowed these words from another supporter because they said so 
eloquently what I too wish to say and why I support these revisions. 
Please support parental rights and what’s good and just for kids.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>I OPPOSE THE PROPOSED 2022 MODEL</strong>
        </div>

<p>I OPPOSE the proposed 2022 Model Policies for the Treatment of 
Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public Schools. This document will 
only hurt transgender students and will undo all the progress we have 
made to protect them from bullying and harrassment. <br><br>1. This 
proposal requires teachers and staff to forcibly “out” students to their
 parents. This is extremely dangerous, as many parents are not 
accepting, thus creating a hostile home environment. This will also 
prevent transgender students from speaking to an adult whom they trust 
at school. Teachers are not only there to teach; they are there to 
provide support and guidance when a student needs it the most.<br><br>2.
 Teachers and staff are prohibited from using a trans student’s name and
 pronouns unless given permission from their parents. Studies have 
proven time and time again that using a trans person’s correct name and 
pronouns significantly improves their mental health and can help prevent
 suicide. By forcing staff to use a student’s deadname and incorrect 
pronouns, you are creating an extremely stressful environment for them. 
In addition, cis children have been allowed to use nicknames that are 
different from their legal names forever; how is a trans child with a 
different name from their records any different? <br><br>3. This model 
requires transgender students to play on sport’s teams that align with 
their assigned sex at birth. This is also dangerous for not only 
transgender students but every student. How is this going to be 
enforced? I fear that genital inspections will become the norm. There 
has also been a news story where a parent wanted to check if a girl who 
beat their child in a sport’s competition was transgender. This is a 
complete invasion of privacy. Sports in schools are also about fostering
 a sense of teamwork and community. You are taking this away from 
transgender children.<br><br>Overall, this model will only HARM 
transgender and non-binary students. It does absolutely nothing to 
protect them in a place they are required to attend every day. It also 
goes completely against all the guidance from medical professionals and 
statistics that show how trans children’s mental health significantly 
improves when we respect them. Please do not let this pass if you truly 
care about children and teens.</p>

<p>The individual's choice of affirming who you are is a natural right. I

Just put yourself in that person's light. How would you want to be

<p>Vilifying children for their choices and decisions is abhorrent. 
&nbsp;The government has no right to interfere in private family 
discussions, nor is it their right to dictate how a student should 
think, feel or express themselves. &nbsp;We all have a right to privacy-
 keep it that way.</p>

<p>I am so happy common sense is prevailing. Trans right often infringes
 on women's/girls rights. They have a right to feel safe in the 
bathroom/camp/changing rooms. I understand it is detrimental to some 
trans to not be able to use the bathroom they want to use, but it cannot
 be at the risk of all girls. Trans are not the only ones with feelings 
and it is time we stop telling girls and women to suck it up and be 
uncomfortable and unsafe. Accommodations should be made but it is not 
the answer to force girls to share spaces with biological men. And 
nothing should be hidden from parents ever</p>

<p>I am friends with transgender and nonbinary people. They are human 
beings that deserve the same rights and respect as any other human 
being.</p>
<p>The full inclusion, protection, and celebration of transgender and 
non-binary youth, including access to extra-curricular activities such 
as athletics and to school facilities, safe and inclusive school 
environments, accurate and inclusive curriculum, and gender-affirming 
school health services. We need to reject the bigoted, ignorant, 
mean-spirited, and discriminatory policies currently being considered by
 far too many state legislatures that seek to exclude transgender people
 and make these members of our communities invisible. Targeting and 
excluding transgender and non-binary students from participation in 
school programming, including athletics programs, alongside their 
cisgender peers is harmful to all students and undermines the learning 
environment for everyone. If schools mark some students effectively as 
outcasts, they foster an environment where no student is included and 
safe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I oppose the draft policy and request that the VDOE reject any anti-trans policies in schools.</p>

<p>It is not appropriate to remove protections for children based on non
 scientific, religious beliefs of one ideological persuasion. This will 
affect any child who wants to go by a different name or is exploring 
their identity in an age appropriate way. It will make teachers jobs 
more difficult and could lead to emotional harm for children of the 
LGBTQ community. Compassion for other is what is needed not 
discrimination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do not waffle. Leftists are going to flood this commenting period 
because you're doing their job. We don't need leftist-indoctrination in 
our schools. Get political ideology out of schools. Stop allowing school
 admins and teachers to think that they know more than parents. Critical
 queer, gender, and race theory have no place in our school. They're 
Marxist indoctrination posing as academic theories and can all be easily
 falsified. Parents deserve better. Our tax dollars deserve to be spent 
in a wise way that benefits society. Not in a way that tears at the 
thread of society by placing government in between families.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am strongly opposed to the proposed guidelines. As the parent of a 
transgender child in the Virginia public schools, I know that this 
proposal puts my child at risk of physical and mental harm. Having been 
part of initial consultations that resulted in the former guidelines, I 
also know how much care was taken to support children like mine to 
ensure that they can thrive and succeed in their education as much as 
cisgender peers; she has thrived under those guidelines, getting all As 
and Bs when previously her report card was full of Cs and Ds. The new 
guidelines being proposed take all that concern for her safety and 
mental health away for a mythical idea of "parent power" that the 
Governor seems to have decided is a vote-getting strategy. Everybody 
knows that parents don't always make best decisions for their children, 
especially when it comes to LGBTQ+ kids -- if they did, we wouldn't have
 conversion therapy or high rates of suicide and homelessness among that
 population.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed guidelines are cynical and shameful politics at their 
worst, putting a child like mine at risk to appease the Governor's 
political base. I oppose these guidelines in the strongest terms.</p>

<p>This is definitely not okay, it’s more important to listen to kids 
and give them a space to grow and be safe than adhere to parents wishes.
 Parents do not own their kids, and their kids should never be forced to
 blindly follow them. Kids deserve the same respect adults do to make 
decisions in a safe environment, which is exactly what this isn’t doing.
 Protect trans kids!!!</p>

<p>The new policy is a cheap political attack on vulnerable Trans 
children. School should be a safe haven for all students. I'm so 
disappointed that the governor and his administration is pushing this 
cruel agenda.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose these new policy guidelines. No doubt plenty of 
other comments will include facts and data surrounding how harmful these
 are, so I won't include them again here. I understand aspects of fear 
concerning bathrooms and safety, but this policy goes beyond any 
debatable safety concerns and stands to just do harm to students that 
desperately are hoping to live their lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's no such thing as a trans child. Activists have hijacked 
education and are flooding it with critical queer and gender theories. 
Both are bankrupt academic ideologues that've been laundered out of 
college and labeled "research". Very soon they're going to start 
crumbling due to expose. Most of these kids who identify as trans suffer
 from a variety of mental health issues. Listen to the kids who are 
de-transing. Don't let the professional activists and agitators sway 
you. Parents matter. Schools and government cannot hide things from 
parents. Children can't make decisions about puberty blockers and 
life-altering decisions. Do not let the professional left scare you. You
 are correct in what you're doing.</p>

<p>This policy is abhorrent, amoral, and likely illegal under existing 
law which the Governor cannot unilaterally overturn. We must protect 
those children who most need protection. Trans and LGBTQ children who do
 not feel safe telling their parents must be protected by their teachers
 and educators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coming from a family with a trans woman in it, why would you try to 
take rights away when it doesn't affect or harm you or others? They 
arent going in the restrooms to peek or anything, they are trying to be 
who they were meant to be. Taking that away from them is pathetic and 
honestly sad. I just want to say that its sad that you are so insecure 
and unconfident in yourself, that you have to take other peoples rights 
away to feel good.</p>

<p>As a teacher, parent, and even more importantly, a human being, I 
oppose in no uncertain terms this legislation being proposed. While 
there is plenty of data to show that trans, and other LGBTQ+ youth 
already suffer from enough ostracism and rhetoric that purports their 
needs as not real, and their identity as made up, it should suffice 
enough to simply say that legislative decisions such as this one are 
inhumane. I cannot imagine a world in which any person, my own child or 
otherwise, telling me they identify as LGBTQ+ would cause me to then 
treat them as LESS of a human. And as a teacher, I know all too well the
 reality that school is the safest place for many of our students. I 
will not be forced by bigoted political legislation to put my students 
in danger either by “outing” them to someone who does not support who 
they are, or by making them feel they must hide who they truly are in 
order to not be “outed”. I cannot believe that we have come so far as a 
society, only to be actually discussing taking such a major step 
back.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>Come on Virginia. We can do better. We MUST do better. Let’s show that we do truly respect and welcome all people.</p>

<p>I stand in support of and advocate for the rights of trans &amp; 
non-binary youth in VA. I oppose the anti-trans policies put forth by 
Youngkin- they go against evidence-based best practice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a transwoman who was raised in a family environment that was not 
safe to be trans, policies such as this remove the school as a safe 
place for trans kids and endanger the safety and welfare of children 
like me.</p>

<p>I am a lifelong resident of Virginia, and I oppose the proposed changes to this guidance document.</p>
<p>Transgender children are at a great risk. The life they must lead is 
inherently difficult, and can be made much worse by humiliations and 
hostility from their community and the adults responsible for their care
 and education. This can unfortunately lead to severe mental health 
struggles and even suicide. It is very important here to take the 
position supported overwhelmingly by science: affirming the gender 
identity of trans people dramatically reduces their suffering, and their
 risk of suicide.</p>
<p>Respectfully, giving transgender people this basic degree of dignity 
is far more important than the "rights of parents" to be bigoted and 
reject someone's very self, religiously motivated or otherwise. The 
former is life-saving. Respecting a transgender person's identity is not
 an ideological position or an opinion; it's a matter of fundamental 
humanity and respect, if you care at all about the well-being of that 
person (as demonstrated by scientific consensus). Therefore, to 
systematically insist that a transgender person is not who they are (as 
these proposed guidelines would allow school staff and students to do 
uninhibited, through condoning the use of incorrect pronouns and names, 
or by requiring trans students to share intimate spaces with members of 
the wrong gender), in complete disregard for the negative consequences 
this will have on that person, is an act of inhuman malice. These new 
guidelines would cause a large amount of harm to vulnerable students, 
and for this reason, I strongly oppose the changes.</p>

<p>Transgender people have always existed, and they have always been 
discriminated against. I have transgender friends and they aren’t 
different or weird, and they haven’t been indoctrinated or brainwashed. 
Nobody is telling them to be trans, it’s feelings they are discovering 
on their own that they are then finding out isn’t uncommon, or abnormal.
 Youngkin is directly targeting transgender youth, a minority where 82% 
of them already have thought about suicide, because they aren’t being 
accepted. Being transgender isn’t hurting anybody, Youngkin IS. We need 
to protect transgender youth, not alienate them even more.</p>

<p>Once again I find myself astounded at the level of hate that Gov 
Trumpkin is waging against the students in Virginia.&nbsp; This policy, 
while alleging parental rights as a premise, does the exact opposite in 
regards to parental involvement.&nbsp; This policy makes the state the 
policy maker, not the parent.&nbsp; Where in these policies are trans 
kids parents represented?&nbsp; But just another cheap shot from a 
Governor who ran on being a moderate, who continues to travel around the
 country supporting the most radical gubernatorial candidates that his 
mentor, Donald Trump, is supporting.&nbsp; Let kids learn where they 
feel safe and supported; Virginia's public schools.</p>

<p><strong>I strongly oppose this proposed policy.&nbsp; This proposal 
would create a hostile and potentially dangerous school environment for 
our VA transgender and nonbinary youth, requiring teachers and staff to 
forcibly “out” students, prohibit staff from supporting trans and 
nonbinary students such as using a students affirming name and pronouns,
 and prohibit access or participation in activities consistent with 
their gender identity.&nbsp; All our students deserve a supportive and 
affirming school environment, especially our vulnerable and marginalized
 populations like our transgender and nonbinary youth</strong></p>

<p>Good morning and thank you for the opportunity to share my opinion. 
&nbsp;As a gay man, growing up in South Boston, VA in the 1970’s, I can 
share with you my horrible experience of being bullied, beat up and 
called gay, sissy, <img src="VirginiaRegulatoryTownHallViewComments1_files/blackbox.gif" alt="black box" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: middle">
 at school. &nbsp;I stayed to myself, didn’t bother anyone, was 
closeted, however knew I was gay and knew God made me and doesn’t make 
any mistakes. &nbsp;I am so grateful I never struggled with religion and
 being gay. &nbsp;I went to school everyday scared. &nbsp;We need to 
support kids and education them and parents on we are all different and 
celebrate our differences. &nbsp;I encourage you to support Trans kids 
and all kids. &nbsp;We need each other!</p>

<p>Being trans is not a fad. People who experience difficulty with their
 assigned gender at birth face a challenging road of self-discovery even
 when they do not have to contend with an entire political party doing 
everything in its power to vilify their support network and their 
choices. Carrying out this policy is a blatant political ploy that will 
result in harm to children, and those who support this policy have 
received ample warning about what it will do. To be clear, Republicans 
did not suddenly become concerned about trans children overnight. They 
already hated trans people and they found a way to legitimize and 
disguise their straightforward bigotry.</p>
<p>If you implement this policy, any harm that comes to trans children 
is blood on your hands. If you really care about helping children, you 
should think long and hard about why you think it's OK to side with the 
group that are perfectly fine seeing trans children suffer and won't 
even concede that whatever their concerns about cis children, some kids 
really are trans and need our help.</p>
<p>Have a heart. Have compassion. Choose caring over cruelty. Do not let this policy be enacted.</p>

<p>The new guidance is shameful and distressing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Kids should feel free to be who they are and not who their 
parents want them to be. Schools should provide a safe environment for 
all and not just heterosexual kid. The Governor claims this guidance is 
for "parental rights" but this is not true. The guidance says that even 
if a parent provides approval for name change, the school can not accept
 it. This isn't about "parental rights" but causing fear and shame to 
the LGBTQIA youth of VA.</p>

<p>A Virginia parent here with cis-kids. If my child had a 
life-threatening issue (like dismissing gender dysphoria can be) and 
they did not feel safe to go to me, I would be grateful there were other
 trusted adults who could support them. The 2021 policy threatens no 
one, while allowing for better mental health outcomes and protecting 
basic human rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This guidance goes against the rights of students, some of whom are 
figuring out who they are. Some are also dealing with family challenges 
and family disapproval, and to not allow them to seek help and solace at
 school will harm them. Some may give up, and that doesn’t need to 
happen. Let’s lean toward kindness, not fear and hate.</p>

<p>Instead of illegally denying the rights of a tiny number of students 
and their parents, Virginia should be spending their resources on 
improving education for all.&nbsp; Raise teacher salaries.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose Governor Youngkin's anti-transgender student 
policy. I want to raise my child in a state where school will be a safe 
and affirming place for them, not a place where they fear for themselves
 or their friends' safety based on their gender identity.&nbsp; This 
proposed guidance is a tool of a reactionary far right administration 
pandering to their base by erasing trans and nonbinary children and 
obstructing their constitutional right to an education.&nbsp; If this 
model guidance is adopted, I would not in good faith be able to raise my
 child in Virginia out of fear that they would be persecuted in a school
 based setting.&nbsp; Because I would prioritize my child's safety, my 
family and I would leave Virginia, taking our tax dollars with us.</p>

          <strong>Gov. Younkin is putting youth in danger</strong>
        </div>

<p>As a queer, nonbinary person myself, gov. younkin's actions are 
putting our community in danger. Apart from the harmful rhetoric about 
trans people in general (who are overwhelmingly more likely to be the 
victim of a crime than the perpetrator of it) both forcing people in or 
out of the closet is going to have costs. Being forced in the closet can
 feel oppressive, as you are forced to act a part for everyone with no 
reprieve to live authentically (an experience glenn will never have to 
understand) on the other hand, being outed before you are ready can set 
people (youth especially) up to face physical and emotional violence at 
the hands of family and peers. LGBT people, especially trans people, 
already have much higher rates of eating disorders, mental illness, self
 harm, and suicide then the general public. More so in communities that 
make it clear that they are not safe and welcome. youngkin is fine 
letting youth suffer to feed a lie passed on by people with power and 
prejudice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone's personal gender or queer identity is no business of the 
state, apart from changing one's name on official documents. This should
 go doubly for youth, who's gender transition consists of nothing more 
than a new name and wardrobe - something many youth queer or otherwise 
will experience. If Abigail wants to go by Abby and dress goth that is 
seen as youthful exploration of identity, however if Abigail wants to go
 by Elliott and dress more masculine they are "indoctrinated" or are 
somehow in danger or putting their community in danger. Exploring your 
identity is essential to growing up, and queer youth deserve to do so 
safely without fearing that adults who are supposed to protect them will
 put them further in danger. </p>
<p>The choice to not capitalize gov. youngkin's name is purposeful - bigotry does not earn the respect of capitalization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To any queer youth (or young at heart) that may be reading this 
looking for any kind of support - it does get better. Our community will
 welcome you with open arms by any name or label that you choose. Seek 
community, pass on as much love as possible, and build other's up in a 
world that constantly wants to tear us down. Queer existence is radical,
 and no person should have to align their identity to fit within the 
confines of the wishes of the state. There is no one mold for being 
human, there are centuries of queer people standing with you, and 
millions waiting to welcome you into our community today.</p>

<p>As someone who is gay - I have noticed a ocncerning trend by the 
community to go after children to spite the right and conservatives. 
There are serious ramifications from this behavior and the best recourse
 is to reciprocate back with the same aggression. To leave kids out of 
this and to cut off exposure to this sub culture in America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many gays, lesbians and trans who do not affiliate with 
that community and belive it has transformed into a cult of hate, spite 
and malice. There is no reason for a child to be exposed to this culture
 other than to confuse and open themselves up to exploitation by the 
LGBT community. Youngkin must do as mich as he can to stop this 
community from doing as much damage as they plan on doing to the state 
of Virginia.</p>

<p>As a grandparent of a dozen children in Virginia schools I am very 
concerned that this action will be followed.&nbsp; My children 
agree.&nbsp; Their Children, my grandchildren need to feel safe in 
school and to not be looked down on and have additional actions put on 
them just because of how they were born, how God made them.&nbsp; I 
don't care if they identify as LGBTQ+ or straight. Let them find out who
 they are and enjoy a safe environment!&nbsp; This proposed policy 
change will cause many children to hide who they are which is hard on 
them mentally and will not allow them to attain the full knowledge they 
are capable of in an accepting society.</p>

<p>While I agree that parents have rights when dealing with children, 
there are many who don't know what is going on with their own 
kids.&nbsp; Schools can be a place where kids can find help and get 
information that parents are not equipped to provide.&nbsp; Sometimes 
the schools need to step in to help protect the children.&nbsp; By 
creating these policies in a vacuum you are ignoring the educators who 
work with kids every day and have great ideas on how to keep them safe 
and allow them to become functioning members of a community.&nbsp; 
Teachers/nurses/counselors that work in schools are parents too and work
 in the best interests of the child - who sometimes are in abusive home 
environments.&nbsp; Please trust the educators to work with the children
 and their parents to come to the best result for the children.&nbsp; 
Create a policy that allows some flexibility and nuancing when it comes 
to dealing with these delicate issues.</p>

<p>Do not reverse the policies in place regarding trans and non-binary 
students. It is not the job of educators to “out” students to their 
families. This is an incredible overreach by the party that used to be 
known for less government intervention. Stop trying to socially engineer
 schools.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our schools need to protect and support all students, including and 
especially trans students, who may not have appropriate support at 
home.&nbsp; No one is harmed by allowing students to express and live by
 their own identify - this should including using bathrooms that are 
appropriate and having their names and pronouns respected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a parent with a student in Alexandria Public Schools, I believe 
this guidance is an embarrassing step backward for the state of 
Virginia, not to mention a violation of the Virginia Human Rights Act.</p>

<p>As a FCPS teacher I am shocked by the number of my peers who believe 
they are qualified and empowered to be mental health counselors to 
adolescents. By all accounts my peers believe they are more qualified 
than the child’s parents and seek to inject themselves into kids lives 
daily.&nbsp;<br><br>Teacher training DOES NOT make you qualified to do this. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The 2022 model policies are going to hurt a lot more students than you're trying to protect.</p>

          <strong>Model Policy Properly Balances Student and Parental Rights</strong>

<p>The model policy properly balances the rights of students to be free 
from discrimination, bullying, and harassment with the rights of parents
 to guide the education of their children.</p>
<p>Further, the policy fulfills the requirement of the 2020 law 
requiring VDOE issue this policy and specifically addresses these issues
 within the confines of federal law and current interpretations of the 
United States Constitution.</p>

<p>These new policies serve to bully the most vulnerable children in a 
transparent effort to score political points in a culture war. Children 
are not pawns. Schools should be a safe place for ALL children, yet 
these policies make schools far less safe for trans children. VDOE 
officials need to educate themselves on the struggles these children and
 their families face daily and implement ways to make schools safer, 
easier, happier places for these children by removing obstacles and 
systems of bigotry that put them at risk. Instead, the current policies 
do the opposite and innocent children will suffer because of them. As a 
Virginia resident and a parent of a school-age child, I strongly oppose 
these new policies and ask VDOE to reconsider and revise them to protect
 trans children, not bully them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the friend of several people who have taken the journey to another
 gender, I know that their decisions were not made lightly. I’m grateful
 to be comfortable in the body I was born with, but we’re not all that 
lucky. Denying the reality of folks who know they are different will 
lead to higher rates of suicide, self-harm and despair. You just have to
 be kind and compassionate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that public schools have been at the forefront of 
the identity politics game, and it is way past time to protect the 
children from this tug 'o war. There is a pandemic of gender dysphoria 
and our most vulnerable population has borne the brunt. Celebration and 
affirmation of such a disorder may not be the best course of action, but
 even if it were, the schools are not in place to decide or pass 
judgement in either direction.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, schools are a place of learning. While some 
bias is unavoidable because teachers and children are human beings, the 
focus of school should be fundamentally education, not social 
engineering. Teachers and counselors are not co-parenting, nor do they 
have the right to attempt to do so. On the other hand, for teachers and 
counselors who do not fall in line with the current progressive march, 
compelled speech like self-generated pronouns is inappropriate and 
violates the 1st Amendment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I would like to see the government step out of education 
entirely, but if it needs to be a necessary evil (which I doubt), then 
its role should be narrowly defined to teach the fundamentals, such as 
reading and arithmetic, writing and history, science and trades, music 
and life skills (such as gardening, cooking, and budgeting).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fully support this attempt to limit the role of our schools in the battle of gender politics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Strongly oppose the drafted changes. If parents want to be involved THEY ALREADY ARE.</p>
<p>Why do you care if someone wants to be called a different pronoun?</p>
<p>Why do you care if a child who looks like a girl goes into a girl's restroom to pee?</p>
<p>Why do we even separate the genders; to begin the oppression of women at an early age?</p>
<p>Leave the children alone and let them grown up to make good choices 
in life. Like how to show compassion, treat everyone with that 
compassion-regardless of their differences and belong to the communities
 at large and not just the LGBTQ+ ones. Equality, diversity and 
inclusion for all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How can a State in the United States be considering this in 2022. 
This is primitive and hateful and harmful. We already avoid the United 
States as a travel destination for backward dangerous thinking. Do you 
want to be judged as religious cult abusers on top of that. This is not 
fine. This is madness. Reject your plan and reject the leaders who 
proposed it to you.</p>

parents are the ones to educate their own children. This is common 
sense. No one is asking for students to be bullied for any reason, but 
no need to mandate that a teacher such as myself would be required to 
act in a manner which they don't believe!! Calling a student by whatever
 they want on any given day is asking for trouble.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model policies put forward by the Youngkin administration are 
dangerous to Virginia's youth, will create a hostile environment for our
 already vulnerable transgender students, and are frankly embarrassing 
for a state that used to be a leader in public education. As the mother 
of a transgender student and two supportive, cisgender LGBTQ+ allies, I 
know first-hand how dangerous it is to a child's physical and mental 
health not to have support and representation at school. Trans youth 
have a disproportionately high rate of mental illness, self-harm, and 
suicide. To not be able to be yourself at school - to be maligned by 
your state's administration for simply being who you are - is 
debilitating and causes lasting harm. These policies will exacerbate 
that while also making it harder for well-meaning teachers and 
administrators to support them. I welcome a conversation with anyone at 
DOE or in the Youngkin administration to help explain, from someone who 
actually has lived experience in this world, how these policies will 
impact our families.</p>

<p>Children/Youth growing up in the public sphere should always be 
allowed to express themselves in a way that they’re comfortable with. 
This includes the use of their own personal pronouns and identifying 
outwardly with how they identify within themselves. Virginia and 
Governor Youngkin needs to let the youth make their way in this world 
they see fit - INCLUDING, sexual identity and orientation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I oppose this because it's wrong on all points. But I got to say this
 too, all children need to be protected, because all children matter. 
Today's times are hard as it is, coming from learning at home to 
attending school again. School at times is a refuge for children, and 
that needs to stay that way. All schools are important and impacted, but
 it's more about public schools, due to attacks on funding public 
schools and the false notion of "indoctrination". The only 
indoctrination that's going on, is trying to force people to hate 
others, and that's not right. People have the right to be who they are 
and live in peace. This is a nationwide problem that truly needs to 
stop, because not only can someone not force someone to do something and
 or be someone they don't want to be, but overall, common sense says 
it's just not a good idea to hate on people period.</p>

<p>I strongly support this new policy that allows parents to parent. 
&nbsp;It seems ridiculous that we need to remind the VA school boards 
about parental rights and the constitution. &nbsp;Let's get back to 
focusing on the academic success of our children and leave politics out 
of school.</p>

<p>Wow! Just wow, I cannot express how horrible this transphobic and 
bigoted law of oppression is going to be! As a queer parent we are in 
2022, we are past all of this hatred and oppression for our children! I 
oppose Youngkin and his transphobia. If you cannot see how difficult 
this will make every child's life you are not paying attention. To ask 
teachers to violate their student's trust is unconscionable! This bill 
is putting children's safety at risk, not just in school but at home! 
Please do not allow this to pass! It shouldn't even be discussed in the 
first place! We should be protecting our kids and allowing them to be 
and figure out who they are! Do not force children, teachers, and 
parents into this! This will only add to trans and queer youth 
depression, suicide, and other harmful activities by creating more 
oppression instead of understanding and support!&nbsp;</p>

<p>ALL kids need to be support for who they truly are even if it is in a way you can't comprehend.</p>
<p>It is THEIR life and not yours. The rigors to even sstart this treatment are strong and have multiple layers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kids need to be accepted and not denigrated.</p>
<p>Oh, I know. To you, only certain kids should be protected and not ALL kids!</p>

<p>This policy will kill children. Revoking gender-affirming resources 
is a well-known cause of suicide for trans children. And a lot of other 
children are going to be really sad when their friends are dead because 
you revoked gender-affirming resources for their friends.</p>
<p>Don't do it.</p>

<p>"Parental Rights" has become a rallying cry for Republicans to 
oppress all public schools parents and children due to the "we want to 
have our cake and eat it too" ignorance of right-wing parents.</p>
<p>Do parents have the right to Home School their own children?&nbsp; YES</p>
<p>Do parents have the right to send their children to private schools, 
including right-wing religious centers of indoctrination?&nbsp; YES 
(Although they should NOT be given public funds to do so.)</p>
<p>Do <em>individual </em>parents have the right, the education, the 
expertise, the experience, the public authority to determine what 
policies, content, books, subjects are included in PUBLIC 
education?&nbsp; NO THEY DO NOT.&nbsp; That's what School Boards are 
for, and they are in turn publicly elected.</p>
<p>I OPPOSE THIS POLICY, AND ALL RIGHT-WING ATTEMPTS TO INDOCRINATE AND 
OPPRESS PUBLIC SCHOOL CHILDREN TO SATISFY THE IGNORANCE OF THE FEW.</p>

undermine previous legislation (i.e.,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vsca.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode%3D1NPMOsRnym3Ax4o4aRFLF%252bZYlwvtdnAQicbWsX8Q79rd3bJmS%252brZFXimAWeEr2%252f78Tx9Enh6IOTK%252fXV9bwhaYoha096W4N0kHgjziJ%252bLANg%253d&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664277562598000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YO7LWiqFW0vbE-jZ_IbUu">§ 22.1-23.3. Treatment of transgender students; policies</a>) that works to create safe and supportive environments for our most vulnerable youth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VSCA recognizes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% 
reported suicidality. School belongingness mitigates these risks and is a
 significant predictor variable for reducing suicidal ideation and 
attempts among transgender youth (Austin et al., 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transgender and nonbinary youth whose schools prevent them from using
 the restrooms/locker rooms that best matched their gender identities 
were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted, 26% for 
transgender males and&nbsp;149% for transgender females (Murchison et 
al., 2019).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted 
suicide in the past year. In fact, when pronouns are respected, 
transgender youth attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did 
not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project, 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transgender adolescents experience significantly disproportionate 
levels of childhood abuse compared to cisgender adolescents and 
experience greater levels of homelessness as a result of being kicked 
out or abused (Thoma, 2021).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fewer than 2.5% of transgender youth re-transition to cisgender (Olson et al, 2022).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Virginia school counselors work to remove barriers and support the 
social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students. VSCA Ends 
Policies state that “Virginia School Counselors&nbsp;are committed to 
working with and advocating for marginalized groups, promote the mental 
health and wellness of all students, adhere to the ASCA Ethical 
Standards for School Counselors, and actively work to dismantle 
destructive systemic inequities.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Virginia school counselors follow the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) Position Statement on&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vsca.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode%3DL6RTA1gphhP9lBTZtbUiGvxeQOLbjXsPKpJN13NN0ZrtBKQHMsF8%252fneQe%252bAzXLxuWVy977vSHgZLXgEVMnwXYmBW8%252fbhf9tbNjxDlO5WULI%253d&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1664277562598000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bYCEtK5kpybkbg0fcpBml">The School Counselor and Transgender and Nonbinary Youth</a>&nbsp;(Adopted 2016, revised 2022) that states:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>School counselors work to safeguard the well-being of transgender and
 nonbinary youth. School counselors recognize all students have the 
right to be treated equally and fairly, with dignity and respect as 
unique individuals, free from discrimination, harassment and bullying 
based on their gender identity and gender expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, Virginia school counselors seek to create environments that 
are not only inclusive and equitable for all students, including our 
transgender, nonbinary, gender non-conforming and gender-fluid students,
 but that celebrate the full scope of their identities, allowing them to
 thrive and reach their fullest potential. Furthermore, Virginia school 
counselors commit to dismantling any and all forms of inequity in 
Virginia’s public education system and fully support LGBTQ+ students. 
Every Virginia student, regardless of their gender identity, gender 
expression, or sexual orientation, has a right to learn free from 
discrimination and harassment.</p>
<p>Against this background, it is VSCA’s stance that the&nbsp;<em>2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools</em>&nbsp;are
 empirically unfounded and are not in accordance with evidence-based 
best practices concerning the treatment of transgender, nonbinary, 
gender non-conforming and gender-fluid students.</p>

<p>I'm a little bit different than the average transgender person. I 
happen to have an unknown muscle condition. The muscle condition gets 
worse with stress and other factors. treating my gender dysphoria 
medically with hormones has been the only thing to help lower my cpks, 
that's the muscle tissue enzymes breaking down. nothing else ever worked
 to lower my cpks to normal.</p>
<p>When you refer to somebody that is transgender and suffering gender 
dysphoria like myself a pronoun that's not appropriate, one that goes 
against my identity.&nbsp; it adds stress which causes my muscles to 
tense and that causes my muscle tissue to break down more.&nbsp; that 
causes toxins to build up into me it's where my organs can fail. It's a 
shame that you think your beliefs are more important than my life and 
health.&nbsp; I transitioned to save my life, Republicans with your hate
 and your ignorance you're negating all my efforts to save my life. All I
 know is ignorance and hate does not belong in schools. and that's what 
this new policy is it's nothing but ignorance and hate. I have a 
neighbor that listens to Youngkin and other people that spread rhetoric 
and lies about transgender people. My neighbor, he says that people like
 LGBT need to be took out and murdered. The fact this policy wants 
teachers to out LGBTQ students to people like my neighbor is wrong and 
dangerous. Not all parents are supportive and some are just like my 
neighbor. I didn't come out to my own parents my mom never knew. my dad 
finally knew late in life. I was scared about losing them, I can't 
imagine the stress that students will feel knowing that you're going to 
try to out them.&nbsp; that stress would have prevented me from having a
 good education at all. the fact that I had to hide my identity 
prevented me from having a good education. I never learned nothing about
 myself in school, not in health class or any other class for that 
matter. I felt alone isolated and scared the whole time. That's what 
you're doing again, repeating history and you're doing wrong by people 
you're causing more harm than any good with this rotten policy.</p>

<p>This bill is dangerous and will have a snowball affect against 
privacy rights. It goes against human rights, goes against separation of
 church and state &amp; will promote bullying within four schools. We 
should be advocating for the youth for safer environments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Studies have proven that those whose identities are questioned face higher rates of suicide.</p>

<p>It costs nothing but human decency to support youth's identities. 
This policy will cost lives. Children deserve to be who they are without
 fear of retaliation or judgement. I vehemently oppose this bill and all
 it stands for. No parents rights are being stripped away by simply 
letting someone's child exist in peace. What about the rights of parents
 of trans youths? Shouldn't they have the right to a safe place for 
their children?&nbsp;</p>

<p>NoVa schools have some of the most diverse LGBTQ, specifically trans,

<p>This is a direct effort to single out and discriminate against kids 
that don't fit into the "cookie cutter" right wing agenda. To directly 
discriminate against trans children is not only immoral, it is unsafe! 
These kids need INCLUSION and understanding. They need love and SUPPORT.
 This is doing the exact opposite of that. It's heartbreaking. It's not 
for the welfare of our children. If that were so, you would not be 
making such a grand stand against a specific demographic of people who 
need protection, inclusion, support and understanding. We should be 
making PROGRESS, and instead, we are taking LARGE strides in the wrong 
direction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These proposed policies are discriminatory and cruel and will be the 
cause of so much harm if passed. Kids go to school to learn, not to be 
disrespected and told who they are is wrong and shameful. What pronouns 
or names kids use has nothing to with learning and education and is 
absolutely not your place to regulate. Banning children from sports 
&nbsp;and telling them what bathrooms they are allowed to use is 
ridiculous. Is banning children from school activities and telling them 
they can’t participate because of who they are, is that what you want 
your legacy to be?? And anyones bathroom use is absolutely none of your 
business. As for forcing schools and teachers to out Lgbtq students and 
tell their parents- absolutely ignorant and an act of violence. You will
 be putting so many children in danger and their blood will be on your 
hands. There are countless parents and family that are unsafe and 
unsupportive and you are putting children at the risk of homelessness, 
abuse, conversion therapy, and death. 50% of all teens get a negative 
reaction when coming out to their parents and 1 in 4 teens are forced to
 leave their homes after coming out. And Roughly 34% of LGBT youth 
report suffering physical violence from their parents as a result of 
their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. You will be actively 
putting kids in harms way. And that’s not even taking into account the 
effects on their mental health. Being told they can’t do this or that 
and their identity is shameful and has to be reported to possible 
unsupportive parents- this will add even more to the mental health 
crisis in lgbtq youths. More than half&nbsp;of transgender and nonbinary
 youth have seriously considered suicide and Lgbtq youth are more than 
four times as likely to attempt suicide than their peers. Discriminating
 against them and regulating every part of them and putting them In 
harms way will only make it worse. Is that the legacy you want? To be 
the ones who increased youths suicide rates and homelessness?? We should
 be encouraging children and helping their lights to grow and be 
confident in themselves, not completely stifling that light. Maybe worry
 more about school shootings and bullying and the youth in poverty that 
can’t afford food or school supplies, instead of what’s in their pants 
and what name they prefer. Do something to make things better for kids, 
not worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a dangerous and harmful policy. It is not for the government 
to decide the gender identities of any person or child. They should not 
be involved in any person or child’s &nbsp;coming out story or journey. 
It’s truly not the business of anyone but that child. Creating policy 
that encourages discrimination of any form is inherently wrong and goes 
against everything that public school stands for. Public education is 
FOR EVERYONE no matter what. As an educator, we aim to accept, 
acknowledge and celebrate that which makes us different and to embrace 
the children in our care as they grow no matter what that journey looks 
like. Virginia is for lovers? Or is it for hateful politics of control?</p>

<p>Not all children are able to trust their parents, but nevertheless 
deserve respect at school as human beings to be who they wish to be and 
be treated as they wish to be treated. There is no harm to them or to 
other students in so doing, and every student has the right to feel 
safe, supported, and respected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 2021 policies have been celebrated by trans students, and have 
made space for families to learn more about their children, rather than 
to direct their lives in an autocratic way. Parents should not control 
every aspect of their child's education or well-being. We know it takes a
 village.</p>

<p>Nearly half of transgender kids attempt suicide in their lives. 
Policies like these are meant to eradicate trans people. There is no 
"religious freedom" to discriminate against any people. If conservatives
 truly care about "the right to life", they will stand against the 
inhumane and immoral policies the Youngkin administration is attempting 
to do.</p>

<p>The 2020 legislation to protect the rights of marginalized and 
endangered LGBTQ+ students was intended to be adjusted based on 
scientific and evidence based grounds. The 2022 proposal is the opposite
 of that. It actively violates the human rights of Transgender and 
Gender Non-Conforming students, because it:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li><strong>X </strong>Allows people to maliciously deadname and misgender students.</li>
<li><strong>X </strong>Prevents students from using their correct name, unless they get parental consent and get it legally changed.</li>
<li><strong>X </strong>Lets parents opt a student out of counseling, regardless of the student’s will.</li>
<li><strong>X </strong>Require schools to out any transgender and gender non-conforming student, and may allow schools to out all LGBTQ+ students</li>
<li><strong>X </strong>Requires parents to control a student’s name, pronoun, and gender expression,&nbsp;regardless of what the student thinks.</li>
<li><strong>X </strong>Prohibits schools from recognizing non-binary pronouns.</li>
<li><strong>X </strong>Bans transgender athletes</li>
<li><strong>X </strong>Bans transgender and gender non-conforming students from using bathrooms that align with their gender identities.</li>
</ul>
<p>LGBTQ+ youth are at a higher risk of suicide and self-harm than their
 peers. This proposal further harms their mental well-being and 
increases institutional discrimination against them. <strong>I implore 
you to reject these proposals and protect these at-risk youth who are 
just a few years away from becoming adults and active voters.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I’d love to see either side of this issue make something that would 
protect the lives of the affected children and preserve the rights of 
parents. However, I have seen firsthand what can happen to a child when 
super conservative parents suspect their child of being either gay or 
transgender. If this is implemented I can very well see child abuse or 
worse happening due to outing gay and transgender students. What is 
currently in place is not perfect but it is a whole lot better than what
 is proposed. Please stop this partisan crap and start working for the 
people that put you in there on the real issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the new Model Policies that Governor Youngkin is 
proposing.&nbsp; Although he is proposing these policies under the guise
 of parental rights, they are written to adversely affect the 
transgender and non-binary population.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>If these policies are really about parental rights, why aren't all 
student required to show legal documentation to be called a nickname or 
preferred name? (ie William to Bill, or Margaret to Maggie)</li>
<li>If these policies are really about Freedom of Speech, affirming 
teachers would not be forced to call a student by their deadname (name 
not preferred) and only go by what is written on their birth 
certificate.</li>
<li>If these policies were about Freedom of Religion - what about 
Freedom FROM Religion? What about compassion for your fellow citizen?</li>
</ol>
<p>Data indicate that 82% of transgender individuals have considered 
killing themselves and 40% have attempted suicide, with suicidality 
highest among transgender youth. (<a rel="nofollow" x="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32345113/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32345113/</a>)
 These policies will only increase the rates at which LGBTQ+ Youth 
suffer from depression, anxiety and possibly suicidal ideations.</p>

<p>I support trans youth. Transness and queerness is something that can 
be discovered immediately in a young persons life, and stifling that 
incredibly important expression often leads to intense depression, 
trauma and often even suicide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My concerns as an educator starts with my students. I am not a 
teacher for parents, I am a teacher for students. I want my students to 
be comfortable and feel safe in the classroom. I have already 
established trust with my trans students, and they know that their 
information is safe with me. If required to ask parents prior to using a
 name or set of pronouns, my students would not be able to be themselves
 in the class, and many would be afraid of repercussions should their 
parents find out. It would be irresponsible and put the lives of 
children at risk should this policy be implemented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an aside, this policy also affects cis children as well as trans 
children. As the policy reads, any child with a nickname "that is not 
commonly associated with their name" (which leaves a lot of wiggle room 
with interpretation. How can I know what is and isn't an associated 
nickname?) who wants to use said nickname in the class, I would be 
required to call their parents and ask if that is okay. Not only is that
 impractical, but it's just nonsense. Requiring parental permission for 
nickname usage has never occurred for cis children, so why is it being 
proposed for trans children?</p>

<p>I am opposed to the proposal by Governor Youngkin that would restrict
 the rights of all students in Virginia, particularly transgender and 
nonbinary students, from peaceful access to a public education. Not only
 is forcing students to identify with a gender that is not their&nbsp; 
own inhumane, but it goes against legal precedent set by the Supreme 
Court.&nbsp; Additionally,&nbsp; I believe this policy would&nbsp; be 
harmful to transgender and nonbinary students, who already experience 
higher rates of bullying, harassment, depression, and suicide.&nbsp; I 
urge the Commonwealth of Virginia to oppose this proposal and protect 
students' freedoms and rights at their schools and in their communities.</p>

<p>This proposal to overturn protections for trans and non-binary 
students is cruel and will cause damage to the mental health of 
students.&nbsp; &nbsp;It infuriates me that Youngkin cares so little for
 the well being of Virginia's youth.&nbsp; Educators and medical 
professionals agree that we need to support the current protections for 
Virginia's students. If Youngkin cared a whit, he'd do a little 
research.&nbsp; But he doesn't care.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I support this and Gov. Youngkin. Schools should focus on teaching 
history, spelling, math and other basic subjects and stop forcing sex 
awareness. America has been dumbed down for to long and the majority is 
hopefully starting to WAKE up.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>PROTECT TRANS &amp; NON-BINARY YOUTH!!!</strong>

<p>I implore the Board of Education to reject these policies as they are
 fueled by hatred and transphobia, and are both disgusting and 
disgraceful.! We must protect transgender and non-binary youth! Trans 
and non-binary children deserve the same safety and autonomy afforded to
 their cis peers. Trans youth face extremely high rates of suicide 
attempts because they already feel excluded, different, and unsafe in 
their own bodies, in their own homes. This policy will have a direct 
effect to make that WORSE for trans children in Virginia schools, make 
no doubt that if enacted this will be responsible for a higher rate of 
suicide among queer kids.&nbsp;The suicide rate for transgender youth is
 already extremely high. 52% of trans youth seriously considered 
suicide, while 21% attempted suicide in the past year. This problem is 
preventable, but the new model policies would exacerbate the issue by 
denying students life-saving social transitions at school. The Trevor 
Project explains that “transgender and nonbinary youth who reported 
having pronouns respected by all or most people in their lives attempted
 suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns 
respected.” This statistic shows that honoring students’ chosen names 
and pronouns is a crucial form of suicide prevention.&nbsp;Moreover, as 
much as we would like to imagine that all parents are supportive of 
their children no matter their gender identity, educators see that this 
is unfortunately not the case: Transgender youth are at a higher risk of
 experiencing homelessness, in part because they are often kicked out of
 their homes or abandoned by caregivers due to their trans identity. The
 Trevor Project states that “38% of transgender girls/women, 39% of 
transgender boys/men, and 35% of nonbinary youth reported housing 
instability and homelessness.” By requiring educators such as teachers 
and guidance counselors to automatically inform parents of their child’s
 transgender identity if the student comes out at school, the state puts
 young people in a position where they must either suppress their 
identities entirely or risk the roof over their heads. Mandating staff 
to out students to their parents puts youth at risk for abuse from 
unaffirming family members. The harm from this action can be anything 
from the guardians pulling the student from school counseling, to 
kicking them out of the home entirely, to physical abuse, suicide, or 
even murder of the child.</p>

<p>This policy is despicable. Trans teens are at extremely high risk of 
suicide- they are much more likely to kill themselves vs harm anyone. 
There is no data that supports the scare tactics of bathroom assaults by
 Trans people. This is discrimination based on hate and fear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be great if all parents were supportive but Trans kids 
routinely get cut off and thrown out of their homes by judgemental 
parents. They are likely to be homeless.</p>
<p>This policy will kill children. So much for being pro-life.</p>

<p>According to Pew research, 5% of young adults in the US identify as trans or non-binary.</p>
<p>Studies show that 40% of trans youth have attempted suicide, and 82% have contemplated it.</p>
<p>Trans and non-binary kids need all the support they can get, both at 
home and at school.&nbsp; If they are not getting support at home, the 
LEAST they should have is support at school.&nbsp; An environment where 
kids are rejected for who they are at home AND at school is where you 
get 40% suicide rates.&nbsp; Is that really what we want for 5% of our 
youth??</p>
<p>For those who wouldn't support their child who came out as trans, 
consider that situation carefully.&nbsp; It can be a life or death 
decision.&nbsp; But I digress...</p>
<p>For those who don't have a trans kid, or don't know a trans kid, or 
don't know anyone who has a trans kid, you probably do.&nbsp; You just 
don't know it yet.&nbsp; Remember, 5%.&nbsp; 5%.&nbsp; This 5% of our 
youth need ALL the love and support the community can give them, and 
this new Younkin policy rips that support away in the guise of "parent's
 rights" and "free speech for teachers".&nbsp; That's laughable.&nbsp; 
This is an anti-trans policy that is cruel, unsupportive, and just plain
 WRONG.</p>
<p>Get it together, Younkin.&nbsp; You're on the wrong side of history here.&nbsp; Kill this policy NOW.</p>

<p>As the parent of a trans child, the policies set forth by the current
 administration. Put the health and well being of an already at risk 
population in greater and unnecessary peril. These policies will isolate
 trans youth from resources they desperately need. All to further the 
political aspirations of one man catering to religious zealots and not 
the people of the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We really need to allow children to speak for themselves on how they 
identify. Our narrow ideas of gender norms are bursting open and we are 
not going back. Allowing parents to have full responsibility and 
allowance to determine how a child identifies is not great because 
parents don't always have their child's best interests in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is so much wrong with this but I don't have the time to unpack it. Strongly oppose.</p>

<p>The bottom line of it all is that this proposed change in policy will
 not help anyone, and it will hurt many. I have lived in Virginia all of
 my adult life, for the last 30 years, I vote in every election, and I 
will vote against anyone who supports these inhumane overreaching 
policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>not appropriate to let children change name/gender without parental

<p>I strongly support Governor Youngkin’s focus on our children’s 
education (most of our state feels the same as that the primary reason 
we elected him). &nbsp;Students who are not trans need to feel 
comfortable at school too. I have absolutely no issue with trans 
students and am fine calling them whatever they want, however the other 
children matter too and we should be understanding of their comfort. My 
child is EXTREMELY uncomfortable changing in the locker room and sharing
 the restroom with trans students. Some kids are scared to express this 
because they are afraid to be labeled and their grades affected. Let’s 
give our wonderful trans kids their own facilities so that ALL children 
may be comfortable. Get back to focusing on academics, the kids have 
lost so much during the covid lockdowns. Thank you.</p>

<p>I am a mother of five that recently pulled my kids out of public 
school due to the radical policies put into place by the last governor. 
They put the safety of my children at risk, not to mention completely 
ignoring my rights as a parent to raise my kids how I see fit. THANK 
YOU, Governor Youngkin, for proposing these changes and giving the power
 back to the parents. Our kids do NOT belong to the school system.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Michael and I am an openly gay man currently residing of 
Hyattsville, Maryland, however for the last 4 years I had lived in 
Arlington and prior to that in Fairfax County. I am writing today to 
express my strong opposition to the Governors proposed changes that 
would directly impact the lives of trans students in the Commonwealth of
 Virginia.<br><br>Transgender students deserve to feel safe and accepted
 just like every other person. and trans youth are already at a higher 
risk of depression, suicide, and violence. This decision is leading to 
make the lives harder of kids and teens already struggling with their 
gender identity and sexual orientation. Some statistics for you to 
consider - 40% of all homeless youth in the United States identify as 
LGBTQ+ (Morton, M.H., Dworsky, A., Matjasko, J.L., Curry, S.R., 
Schlueter, D., Chávez, R. &amp; Farrell, A.F. (in press). Prevalence and
 correlates of youth homelessness in the United States. <em>Journal of Adolescent Health</em>.), three-quarters of students who identify as transgender or non-binary have felt <a rel="nofollow" x="https://assets2.hrc.org/welcoming-schools/documents/WS_School_Climate_for_Transgender_Students_Data.pdf">unsafe at school</a>
 because of the way they expressed their gender (75.1%), and of those 
students who identified as “another gender” or “genderqueer,” two-thirds
 felt unsafe at school (‘another gender” 61.2% and “genderqueer” 61.6% 
). Finally, trans people are over 4 times more likely than cisgender 
people to be victims of <a rel="nofollow" x="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/ncvs-trans-press-release/">violent crime.</a></p>
<p>This guidance also runs the very real risk of forcing teachers to out
 students against their will, which could lead to the potential of 
violence and abuse against the child. I want to make this very clear, 
just because it is 2022 and the LGBTQ+ rights movement has made strides 
over the last decade or so does not mean we are completely safe. Even 
now kids are thrown out of their homes, beaten and abused just for being
 who they truly are. People who are LGBTQ+ deserve the right to come out
 to people when they are ready and only when they are ready, as I did at
 the age of 21. &nbsp;<br><br>Children deserve to feel safe at school 
and at home, and I hope the administration will change its stance and 
stop this dangerous guidance from going into effect.</p>

<p>I oppose these changes to school policies that prevent Transgender 
students from using facilities that correspond with their gender 
identity. &nbsp;Being Transgender is real, not an illness. &nbsp;I know 
many transgender people and they are exactly like every cisgender person
 I’ve known. &nbsp;Like Dwyane Wade said, it’s not the transgender kids 
that have a problem. &nbsp;It’s the adults mentality that’s the problem.
 These Transgender students know who they are better than most. 
&nbsp;Preventing them from using the bathroom and locker rooms at school
 will not erase them. Keeping them out of sports will not make them go 
away. Outing these kids to their parents who may be very hostile and 
harmful will not stop them from existing. &nbsp;But the resulting teen 
suicides will destroy many families, of every political affiliation. 
&nbsp;We all want what is best for our kids. But don’t be afraid of your
 children interacting with Transgender classmates or passing by them in 
the bathroom. You should get to know them. You will love them or dislike
 them just like you would any other kids. &nbsp;These policy changes are
 harmful. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose these measures, clearly created to limit the rights
 of some of our most vulnerable students. Trans and non-binary children 
need to be supported in every way that we can, not othered further and 
discriminated against. These guidelines are cruel and support a bigoted 
power system. If they are enacted, they will create harm and 
discrimination, and fail to provide human rights to students who 
desperately need support. We should be expanding rights to our Trans and
 non-binary students through counseling, teacher support and inclusive 
school environment structures. Supporting the rights of these students 
does no harm to teachers or students around them.</p>

<p>This bill is 100% based in bias and cruelty.&nbsp; In order to learn 
best students need to feel comfortable and supported, this is NOT how to
 support them.&nbsp; As a teacher, I am appalled at the Governor's 
narrow views of what actually occurs in public schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ALL students deserve protection and comfort, we cannot deny that 
entire groups of students don't exist because the narrow minded fear 
them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose and think these are basic equal human rights you 
are trying to take away! They are children who have been &nbsp;through 
enough and sure as heck do not need schools turning again at them too. 
Leave them alone and let them be children regardless of how they 
identify!!!!</p>

<p>As an educator, this policy is absolutely disgusting. Children play 
and experiment all the time, and there’s no reason this is any 
different.</p>
<p>No one should be able to force their beliefs about gender on me or my students.</p>
<p>Stop the hate, and stop forcing teachers to enforce bigotry. Be a bigot on your own time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. Read the science. Research shows that denying someone’s identity
 can be deadly. This is not worth another child suicide. It. Is. 
Not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trans kids are the most vulnerable population that we have. Stop 
using them as political pawns, we all see this for the abhorrent 
political ploy that it is. Leave them alone!</p>

<p>Keep boys out the girls bathrooms. If you were born with a penis you 
use the boys bathroom, period. People need their heads examined and 
psychological help if you’re under 18 and do not know what you are. 
Parents and media quit shoving this mess down children’s throats when 
they’re still learning who they are. Two genders, boy and girl, common 
sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the guidelines proposed by the Board of Education. I
 believe they are dangerous, harmful and discriminatory. School should 
be a safe, accepting and supportive environment for all students, 
especially LGBTQ+ students.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Students should not be deadnamed or forced into the wrong bathrooms.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Many
 students are not able to safely come out to their families, let alone 
be accepted. They should be able to be out at school and live their 
truth without fear that they will be outed to their families. Outing 
students will inevitably lead to some students being abused at home, and
 some harming themselves. This harm is preventable and the blood will be
 on the hands of Governor Youngkin's Board of Education. These 
guidelines will worsen bullying and harassment of transgender and other 
LGBTQ+ students.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">As
 stated by Dr. Moira Szilagyi, the president of the American Academy of 
Pediatrics, "The emotional and psychological trauma of rejection, 
whether by family, friends, society, or lawmakers, can leave scars that 
never heal.?When we fail to accept people for who they are, we pass 
painful judgements on them and create so much unnecessary emotional and 
psychological pain."</span></p>
<p>These guidelines must be rejected to protect Virginia's LGBTQ+ youth.</p>

<p>I am a teacher in Charlottesville City schools and agree with the 
emphasis on referring to parents for how to support their students. 
However, I do think the term "parents" can be limiting to many student 
situations I know. I think "families" is a much better umbrella term 
that includes grandparents, aunts, uncles, other guardians who may be 
the authority in a child's life. Other than this vocabulary piece, I 
agree with the emphasis on using family guidance and decisions to inform
 the way we interact with students in the classrooms.</p>

<p>As a young woman at a public high school, I feel incredibly upset and
 threatened at the idea of sexually unstable men masquerading as women 
for their own private fetishes. Keep them out of my space. Let their 
parents know what they’re up to.</p>

<p>Each morning when the school bell rings and the school door opens, 
every student entering should feel an equal sense of belonging. Research
 clearly shows the cost when kids feel disconnected and isolated. We 
need to be in a hurry to love and respect all students and to enact 
policies that will help prevent suicide and substance abuse. Changes to 
the 2021 policy should be rejected.&nbsp;</p>

transgender or other LGBTQ+ students.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>While there is 
plenty of data to show that trans and other LGBTQ+ youth already suffer 
from enough ostracism and rhetoric that implies their needs as not real 
and their identity as made up, it should suffice enough to simply say 
that legislative decisions such as this one are inhumane. I cannot 
imagine a world in which any person, child or adult, telling me they 
identify as LGBTQ+ would cause me to then treat them as LESS of a human.
 Our schools should be the safest place for our students. No teacher or 
staff member should be forced by bigoted political legislation to put 
these children in danger either by “outing” them to someone who does not
 support who they are or by making them feel they must hide who they 
truly are in order to not be “outed”.&nbsp; I cannot believe that we 
have come so far as a society, only to be actually discussing taking 
such a major step back.<br><br>We have to do better.&nbsp; We have to 
provide these students with safe placed to learn.&nbsp; We have to 
provide them support and encouragement to be who they are.&nbsp; And 
above all, we MUST treat them with respect and dignity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the Commonwealth that ALL students have 
the opportunity to receive a high-quality education in Virginia (see: 
Code of Virginia, § 22.1-23.3).</p>
<p>To quote, "The Virginia Department of Education (the “Department”) 
recognizes that each child is a unique individual with distinctive 
abilities and characteristics that should be valued and respected. All 
students have the right to attend school in an environment free from 
discrimination, harassment, or bullying. The Department supports efforts
 to protect and encourage respect for all students. Thus, we have a 
collective responsibility to address topics such as the treatment of 
transgender students with necessary compassion and respect for all 
students. The Department also fully acknowledges the rights of parents 
to exercise their fundamental rights granted by the Fourteenth Amendment
 of the U.S. Constitution to direct the care, upbringing, and education 
of their children. The Code of Virginia reaffirms the rights of parents 
to determine how their children will be raised and educated. Empowering 
parents is not only a fundamental right, but it is essential to 
improving outcomes for all children in Virginia. The Department is 
mindful of constitutional protections that prohibit governmental 
entities from requiring individuals to adhere to or adopt a particular 
ideological belief. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution 
guarantees religious freedom and prohibits the government from 
compelling speech that is contrary to an individual’s personal or 
religious beliefs."</p>
<p>This guidance document completely contravenes the current legal 
protection offered to all children by the Virginia Department of 
Education. Governor Youngkin's deliberate attempt to politicize and 
weaponize children in service of his own political popularity is 
disgusting. You have a responsibility to ALL children and ALL parents in
 this state.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this proposed policy. &nbsp;This proposal would 
create a hostile and potentially dangerous school environment for our 
youth, requiring teachers and staff to forcibly “out” students, prohibit
 staff from supporting trans and nonbinary students such as using a 
students affirming name and pronouns, and prohibit access or 
participation in activities consistent with their gender identity. 
&nbsp;All our students deserve a supportive and affirming school 
environment, especially our vulnerable and marginalized populations like
 our transgender and nonbinary youth. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I would love to know what makes anyone on this committee a leading 
voice for the trans community? Assuming most, if not all of you, are 
cisgender, what authority do you have to tell a select group of 
individuals what they can and cannot do when compared to a separate 
group? Who are you to decide who goes into which group? What makes you 
think it is even possible to group humankind into a different bills and 
then try to exploit and dehumanize them? You know nothing about the 
topics you speak on and it is abundantly clear you only want to cause 
harm. You enjoy it, we can tell, but do you really not have anything 
better to vote on? Like starving children? Or homeless people? Or your 
police department running rampant? Leave trans kids alone.</p>

<p><strong>As a person working in the psychology field, I know the effects this will have on trans youth. Being&nbsp; Transgender is a <em>biological&nbsp;</em>condition.
 We know from scientific research that the brain masculinzes or 
femininzes in utero and continues to do so after the birth of the child.
 The masculinization or feminization of genitals of fetuses happens in 
the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. In the case of trans 
people, that masculinization or feminization of the brain was NOT 
complete. Oppression of their <em>biological deviations&nbsp;</em>is 
abuse. This psychological abuse can and will lead to higher rates of 
suicide among transgender youth. That will be their blood on your hands.
 Make the decision to care for your trans youth, or deal with the 
consequences of your inaction</strong></p>

<p>I strongly oppose this. Policies such as this will endanger our kids.
 All medical studies into transgender children show that the best 
outcomes come from a supportive environment that listens to the child. 
And this does not do that. I’m arrears that children will does from 
policies such as this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>transgender students make up less than 1% of students. the 
irreparable harm this proposal outlines is abusive and WILL cause 
suicidal thoughts and actions. I beg you all to think about that for a 
moment. think of your children or the children you see in your 
community. you do NOT know if they are trans. you do NOT know what they 
are struggling with. Think of the kids who are trans, even if you hate 
them, do you really want a dead kid on your hands? your job is to ensure
 the safety and comfort of these students. a policy targeted at so few

<p>I am a father who recently pulled my kids out of public school due to
 the radical policies put into place by the last governor. They put the 
safety of my children at risk, not to mention completely ignoring my 
rights as a parent to raise my kids how I see fit. THANK YOU, Governor 
Youngkin, for proposing these changes and giving the power back to the 
parents. Our kids do NOT belong to the school system.</p>

<p>Trans Virginians deserve to be able to feel safe in school. Safety 
from bullying, safety from physical and sexual assault, and safety from a
 malicious faculty member opening them up to abuse from their parents. 
Glenn Youngkin is cynically taking away the only supportive environment a
 lot of trans kids can count on, and for what? 8th place in the Iowa 
caucuses. Disgusting.</p>

<p>This policy has nothing to do with school and is just a way to place 
more rules upon teachers for no reason. While Trans rights may be hard 
to understand for some people, instructing all schools to ignore the 
wishes of children is hurtful.</p>
<p>Some people may say that we can't just let kids choose their gender 
because we don't let kids do things that aren't safe for them, but 
forcing children to pretend to be what they do not wish to be is more 
hurtful than helpful.</p>
<p>I strongly oppose this policy on the grounds that it is hurtful, harmful, and completely unnecessary.</p>

<p>It is embarrassing to me as a lifelong Virginian, and an educator, 
that this "guidance" was even put forward.&nbsp; It is not based on any 
evidence supporting student health or well-being.&nbsp; It will cause 
terrible damage to students and families and educators.&nbsp; &nbsp;It 
is based in bigotry, ignorance, and fear-mongering.&nbsp; It is an 
embarrassment to all Virginians that this "guidance" even saw the light 
of day.&nbsp; Virginia already has highly ranked educational programs at
 all levels - stop politicizing schools with cheap political stunts and 
taking attention and resources away from our students and teachers, who 
deserve informed leadership.&nbsp; This administration should be 
ashamed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am the mother of three Henrico County students and an advocate for 
all children. This policy is harmful to our students - our public 
schools are tasked with protecting ALL students who attend, not just 
those who are not transgender or non-binary. To single this population 
out in this manner is cruel. These are CHILDREN who need an entire 
community's love and support. Please focus on issues that really matter,
 such as improving our student's reading and writing skills, or offering
 healthier cafeteria options, or increasing pay to retain teachers. This
 policy is a waste of everyone's time.</p>

<p>Children need protection from or elected officials &nbsp;This is 
particularly true of marginalized groups that are threatened by 
discrimination and violence. &nbsp;I am a therapist with experience 
working with gender diverse children, teens, and adults. &nbsp;The 
Youngkin administration's proposed policy is selfish and cruel. &nbsp;It
 would result in extreme harm to our youth. &nbsp;This harm will almost 
certainly include an increase in suicide. &nbsp;That is on the governor.
 &nbsp;I know that we all agree that our children should be treated with
 love, respect, and support. &nbsp;The evidence is overwhelming that we 
support the bio/pscho/social journeys of transgender youth.</p>

<p>Transgender kids are at very high risk for suicidal behavior - not 
because they are transgender, but because of how they are treated by 
others, including peers at school. We should be doing everything we can 
to SUPPORT vulnerable kids. This policy is mean-spirited and tells our 
kids that adults don't care about their well-being - that they are just 
political fodder. Imagine if the government told you tomorrow that you 
now had to live as the other gender - not giving you the option, but 
telling you that you MUST use the other bathroom in public places and 
MUST use a name and pronouns THEY think are right for you. You would 
think this was a violation of your privacy, and that is exactly what 
this new policy is.</p>
<p>I am STRONGLY OPPOSED to the guidance document on Model Policies for 
the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public Schools.</p>

<p>Children need to be safe at school, the accommodations are there. 
School is for education not biological confusion. We do not offer 
liposuction for the anorexic. Gender dysphoria deserves proper diagnosis
 too. Support kids.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Treat all students with dignity and respect. Never bend a knee to floating pronouns.</p>
<p>End grooming and all indoctrination. Access to all classrooms. Never 
withhold information from parents who are the responsible authority.</p>
<p>One needs to know over the past 15 years or so as teachers have 
assumed greater and greater rolls in our children's education have 
suicides decreased. I think otherwise .</p>

<p>Trans rights are human rights. No one is using their bathroom of 
choice to assault others. Trans people are actually more likely to be 
victims of assault. This is such a gross overstep by the government. 
Don’t tell people where to pee, just let them do their business and stay
 out of theirs.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Proposed Policy is discriminatory and unconstitutional </strong>

<p>This proposed policy is cruel to kids who already have it hard 
enough. That should be enough to stop this policy from taking effect. 
But seeing as how Virginia's current leaders may not care about how 
cruelly they treat kids, I would also point out that there are serious 
legal issues with the proposed policy as well, including constitutional 
problems. Discrimination against trans kids is unlawful sex-based 
discrimination. Supreme Court rulings have made this clear. 
Additionally, Virginia has a <a rel="nofollow" x="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-human-rights-act/" target="_blank">Human Rights Act</a> that bars discrimination in schools based on gender identity. This policy violates Virginia's own law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this government wants to tie itself up in the costs of prolonged 
litigation while at the same time harming vulnerable kids, it will go 
forward with adopting this cruel, unnecessary policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reconsider for the sake of kids and the law and do not go forward with this policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>September is Suicide Prevention Month. Act like it. We all know that 
suicide rates skyrocket when transgender children do not receive 
support. This awful legislation will lead to more suicide. I strongly 
oppose this legislation. I will always stand with transgender children. 
I’m asking you to do the same.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only is this unenforceable, it is a fundamental violation of 
students' and teachers' rights as in Oyez, and a deliberate 
misinterpretation of federal anti discrimination law. To compel 
misgendering and humiliation is not something all educators are willing 
to put up with, nor should we put young people up against violence and 
abuse at home once they are outed. This is a morally bankrupt, 
fact-free, performative waste of time. Every day it seems the "parental 
rights movement" is really about absolute control- abuse- of kids. Leave
 kids alone and keep trans kids safe!&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a compassionate policy that complies with existing laws, 
recognizes science, and restores parental rights. Any policy that allows
 school officials to keep secrets from parents is dangerous to children 
and evil. Children must be protected from those who seek to take 
advantage of their innocence and lack of maturity. Children depend on 
adults with a strong moral compass to guide them. Those who seek to 
operate in secrecy do so to enable evil and lack the moral compass to be
 around children. Thank you for taking the stance to restore parental 
rights and to protect children.</p>

<p>It is wrong to expose the privacy of transgendered children. If they 
choose to come out then that is their decision and NO ONE ELSE’S! This 
policy will be harmful to scores of children who are simply trying to 
grow up and figure out their identity just like all of their peers. Many
 also risk backlash and harm from closed minded people who would disown 
them simply for being their true selves. Cisgendered children do not 
have to go through such an egregious breach in privacy, so why should 
transgendered children? Do not allow this bill to pass!</p>

<p>I was outed to my parents by a guidance counselor in high school and 
it kept me from being myself for many years. &nbsp;Even if the parents 
are supportive, this is a deeply humiliating thing to do to children who
 already have every aspect of their life measured and compared to others
 in school. &nbsp;Children are full individuals who deserve privacy, 
dignity, and respect. &nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Bring Back 2021 Model Policies</strong>
        </div>

<p>The 2021 model policies for transgenered students were carefully 
crafted with a lot of input and collaboration from every type of 
stakeholder. The categories of stakeholders involved is clearly stated 
in the document, and it includes parents. However, the 2022 model 
clearly states that it includes the VALUES of parents. This is 
disturbing as a "wolf disguised in sheeps clothing". The basic issue 
here is NOT about empowering parents. People who are uninformed about 
transgenedered individuals are fearful and naturally want to protect 
their own children. And we all know that many children do not value 
peers who are different. This issue in the 2022 model policies was 
clearly written with a reactionary lens. It's not ok to discriminate 
against trans kids due to our personal values. This issue is about 
protections sadly necessary for transgenedered students. "The Virginia 
Department of Education continuse to be ommitted to working with school 
divisions to ensure a positive, safe, and nurturing learning environment
 for all students." Note that the quote states "all students", not just 
cis students. Please, let's empower trans students to live the lives 
they choose to, without discrimination against them and threats to their
 physical and mental well-being.</p>

<p>Youngkin and the DOE are blatantly disregarding science and the mental health of trans youth. The proposed policy is cruel.</p>
<p>I'd advise all of those involved with this proposed language to talk 
to doctors and scientists who actually understand the implications of 
such a policy and address their errors.</p>

being encouraged to do by others.</p>

<p>As a person who identifies as trans and went to public school in 
chesterfield county, I can say that this policy will lead to an even 
bigger rise in suicide rates amount trans kids. We just want to live. We
 are scraping by to survive just dealing with our own identities etc and
 we do not need adults controlling EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF OUR LIVES. We 
matter just as much as you. We matter just as much as your child. If you
 pass this policy, YOU are going to have blood on YOUR hands. YOU are 
going to be the reason for these kids killing themselves. It will all be
 on YOU! YOUR fault, not their parents and not theirs. I URGE YOU TO NOT
 PASS THIS POLICY. DO NOT BE THE REASON FOR COUNTLESS SUICIDES. I am 
begging you to allow trans kids to be KIDS. If you can allow a cis child
 to do what they want you HAVE to let a trans child do the same exact 
things. If you’ll recall there’s a word called “discrimination” which 
seems to have been forgotten when it comes to people who are not cis, 
straight, white, a male, a Christian, etc. If YOU have rights then so do
 I and if you think otherwise, WE WILL NOT STOP UNTIL WE ARE 
EQUAL.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">By continuing to treat trans and 
nonbinary people as less than human, without the decency to live 
authentically as themselves, this policy will inevitably lead to more 
suicides in children. I don't think the people who wrote this policy 
understand how vital it is that we allow our children to be themselves. 
Trans and nonbinary children without supportive family and teachers will
 become depressed. They just want to live happy lives, as themselves, 
and this policy is setting them up for failure by refusing to 
acknowledge that they are people independent of their parents 
identities. Parents, your children are not meant to be extensions of 
yourself. They are not supposed to be mini-yous. They are their own 
person, and trying to force them to be what they are not will backfire 
spectacularly on you. I know I likely cannot change the minds of 
transphobes, but I will fight like hell to protect our children from 
them. If you continue with this policy, I swear you will have their 
suicides on your heads. May God forgive you for the sin you commit by 
enacting this policy.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">These policies are not on contrary to state law, but will be extremely harmful to trans kids. Do better!</p>

<p>I am writing to express strong support for the model policies. If 
anything, policies do not go far enough to protect students from 
activist teachers. Parents should be informed of everything. No secret 
names, no secret closets. Teachers don't get to substitute their 
judgement for parents' when they don't agree with their choices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This proposed model will harm these kids who are already vulnerable. 
Not all children have supportive parents, and they will be at risk for 
greater abuse if this moves forward.</p>

<p>More than 50% of transgender youth contemplate suicide. The fear of 
being rejected by the people they love the most often stops them from 
coming out and addressing the depression they feel. As a parent I would 
rather my child come out to anyone they feel safe with than for them to 
possibly decide they can’t take it and in a moment of fear take their 
own life. &nbsp;Children, teens and young adults are more likely to 
follow through with thoughts of self harm as the frontal lobes of their 
brain are not fully developed. Being transgender is hard for a child 
they don’t feel like they belong in their own body. This policy could 
actually kill children.</p>

<p>This policy will force teachers to call students by whatever is in 
the system regardless of if the child strongly opposes the name. Why 
should a parent have to sign off on what a child wants to be called by 
teachers and peers? We understand that someone mispronouncing a person’s
 name constantly is considered disrespectful, why does this not apply to
 calling a trans child by the name they don’t identify with?</p>
<p>Trans people have high suicidal thought and attempt statistics. This policy will only make those statistics worse.</p>

<p>As a cisgender former student of Gloucester High School, I supported 
trans student's rights while Gavin Grimm was taking GHS to the Supreme 
Court and I continue to support them now as a student employer in a 
Higher Education setting. Schools should let students explore their 
identity without punishing or embarrassing them in front of their peers.
 I believe this policy is a violation of student privacy.</p>

<p>&nbsp; This policy is political theater meant to appeal to the 
far-right crowd.&nbsp; This does not consider the rights of teachers and
 students.&nbsp; The far-right crowd wants to believe that educators are
 "encouraging" students to become trans, but many students are still 
trying to find out who they are. Being supportive and building trust is 
essential in the classroom.&nbsp; No one is encouraging students to come
 out as trans--educators are simply being accepting of their 
students.&nbsp; Classrooms are meant to be inclusive.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Nobody should be forcibly outed. Nobody should be forced to use

<p>I oppose the proposed policy reversal b/c it doesn't give autonomy to
 trans and non-binary students and doesn't allow them to feel safe or 
gender-affirmed in their school environment. Please keep the Northam-era
 policies in place - they are better for students, parents, schools, and
 our communities as a whole.</p>

<p>The previous policy was an overreach and failed to demonstrate a 
compelling interest to exclude parents from critical information 
regarding the safety and well-being of their children. Thank you 
Governor for enforcing the 14th Amendment protections of families and 
recognizing that parents are in the best position to determine what is 
best for their child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a well-thought-out policy that identifies the LAWS that are applicable, as well as case precedent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am opposed to this policy as it approaches legalization of 
bullying.&nbsp; There needs to be a better balance of the rights of 
teens to realize their gender identity with grace and compassion.&nbsp; 
This policy actually prohibits teachers from using preferred pronouns 
without permission in writing from parents, and allows them to not use 
them even if the parents expressly give permission to do so.&nbsp; This 
is a subtle form of bullying and prioritizes personal beliefs of 
teachers over those of students and even parents.<br><br>I remember how 
much I hated using public restrooms in school when I was growing up 
without having to navigate it through personal gender identity 
questions.&nbsp; I can't even imagine the level of anxiety produced by 
that.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose any government interference in the self-expression 
of children understanding their identity. The human mind and body is 
more complex than the fears of religion. We do not live in the United 
States of Jesus Christ. Public schools are for ALL children.</p>

<p>There is no reason to aid in children attempting suicide, which we

this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I fully support Youngkin's policy.&nbsp; I fully support parent's 
rights - schools (the state) should never keep information from 
parents.&nbsp; I fully support protecting our kids - restrooms/locker 
rooms should be separated by gender (not gender identity).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our public schools are NO PLACE to be pushing gender ideologies!!</p>

<p>This proposal will do nothing to ensure trans people are treated 
equally, humanely, or safely. Those who advocate for "parents' rights" 
in education and defend themselves for being transphobic by citing the 
First Amendment are almost universally not interest in the welfare of 
any children, and are rather using children in schools to push for their
 agenda of making trans people unacceptable in public. Repealing 
previous protections because parents have complained about their right 
to control their child's education and environment is not only an absurd
 overreaction to the concerns of a minority on an issue that does not 
affect their child's safety, it is an overreach of the BoE in that it is
 listening only to a privileged few who dedicate their lives to hurting 
others and allowing transphobes to control the school system. No other 
group this small has ever been granted this much power to control the 
policies that affect every student in Virginia. If parental rights are 
so important, what about the right of trans children's parents to not 
have to treat their children's depression and inability to be 
themselves? Because that's what they're going to have to do if the 
proposal becomes policy. The people supporting this proposal don't care 
about children, they just want to be able to train their children that 
hating and hurting others is normal, okay, and encouraged. Don't let 
them.</p>

<p>This proposed policy is silly at best and inhumane at worst. If a 
student chooses to go by a nickname at school, must parents produce 
legal documents? If students fear a negative or even abusive parental 
reaction to their identities, must educators choose between ignoring a 
student's wishes or subjecting that student to potential abuse? Parents 
have a right to know their children are safe at school, and these 
policies, in addition to be illegal per §&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" x="http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-23.3">22.1-23.3</a>, will harm student safety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't actually expect anyone in the Youngkin administration to read
 these comments because he ran on a platform to harm kids. &nbsp;But 
I'll add my comment anyway. &nbsp;When a child is in an abusive 
household, often times their only safe place is school. &nbsp;This 
policy removes that safe space and now puts more kids at risk of abuse 
and abandonment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Far more kids are abused by members of their own family or their 
faith community than by schools which have structures in place to 
prevent abuse. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This legislation is unconstitutional. Students have a right to 
privacy and dignity. Trans youth are one of the most marginalized groups
 in the world and this will lead to more death and tragedy. All students
 have a right to dignity of not being misgendered by school staff. All 
students have a right to privacy to not be outed to their homophobic 
parents. All schools must be inclusive to all students and treat them 
with respect. I am a Virginia public school alum and I expect schools to
 become more safe for all students, including trans students. This 
policy is shameful and barbaric. Trans rights are human rights</p>

<p>I strongly oppose Youngkin’s proposed roll back on transgender kids’ 
rights. As a parent of a transgender child, &nbsp;this is NOT about 
parental rights. Please take a cue from the Republican governor of Utah 
who doesn’t see eye to eye, but understands these are vulnerable 
children who deserve protecting, not bullying- which is what this 
is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forcing trans girls into restrooms full of men will put them in 
danger and will encourage men do enter girl's toilets to do 
"investigations".&nbsp; Banning pronouns is literally restricting 
speech. Outing people willlet bigots find easy victims to hurt peope.</p>

          <strong>Harmful Policy for Transgender Youth </strong>

<p>It is incomprehensible that Gov. Youngkin has a genuine reason to 
propose this policy after the transgender policy, created by Gov. 
Northam, was designed according to best practices, after extensive 
research and aligns with the&nbsp; Virginia Human Rights Act. 
Furthermore, studies consistently show that transgender children have 
higher rates of suicide, depression and anxiety, especially if they are 
Black or Brown women,&nbsp; as assaults and murders of transgender women
 are an epidemic, according to the Leadership Council on Human and Civil
 <a rel="nofollow" x="https://civilrights.org/resource/open-letter-supporting-the-full-inclusion-of-transgender-students/#_ftn2" target="_blank">Rights.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a perfect recipe for bullying, raping and shaming transgender
 students. Furthermore, LGBTQ plus children are subject to abuse and 
familial rejection if their parents refuse to acknowledge their gender 
identity, which is traumatizing.</p>
<p>Governor Youngkin is exploiting children to further his political 
goals, as children as young as three experience gender dysphoria. I 
sincerely hope that the state superintendent soundly rejects this 
harmful policy and shows their support for the rights of all students.</p>

<p>All evidence suggests that acceptance of trans identities leads to 
better outcomes. Forcing kids to out themselves or de-transition will 
have harmful effects. Let people be who they are and quit using trans 
people as a political cudgel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am commenting to strongly oppose these guidelines as they will 
further harm at risk kids and erode school districts rights and 
obligations to offer safe education to all students. Although these 
guidelines are supposedly in support of “parental rights” they only 
support parents who have one viewpoint. And we cannot sacrifice the 
actual rights of the students for supposed parental rights. All students
 deserve to be treated with respect and supported by their schools and 
teachers. I am a parent with a child in the Fairfax County Schools and I
 do not wish for our school system to be bound by these guidelines. Also
 I believe the guidelines violate Virginia Law, including recently 
passed Human Rights legislation.&nbsp;<br>LQBTQ+ kids deserve support and respect and not to be political pawns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do not give in to the demands of a tiny portion of misguided people 
about a phenomenon that will be looked back upon by history as utter 
insanity.&nbsp; If you want to pretend your child is another gender for 
attention, maybe you are the one who should homeschool instead of 
rational parents having to change everything to accommodate your mental 
illness.&nbsp; Children are assigned a gender at birth because gender is
 a biological fact.</p>

<p>As a Canadian watching the deepening divide south of our border, 
knowing that these divides inevitably colour the Canadian political 
landscape, I must voice my strong opposition to this policy as early as 
possible.</p>
<p>Our culture gives youth too little credit. We do not trust our own 
children to speak their minds and make their own decisions. Coddling 
them and speaking for them does them terrible disservice. We must foster
 strong critical thinking skills and bring fresh minds and voices to the
 table as they grow into adults.</p>
<p>This bill hamstrings kids. It tells them that they cannot speak or 
think for themselves. It sets them up to stagnate, parroting the 
opinions of the previous generation without ever having the chance to 
form their own.</p>
<p>We must do better by our kids. Let them speak for themselves. As a 
parent, if you disagree with what your child is saying, TALK TO THEM. 
Don't legislate their voice away. You may find your own opinion changes 
in the process.</p>

<p>I strongly OPPOSE any changes to the 2021 guidelines. The proposed 
changes will hurt and endanger LGBTQ+ kids. Requiring faculty and staff 
to out trans and nonbinary kids to their parents is cruel and inhumane. 
Kids should be allowed to identify how they wish instead of having 
compulsory heterosexual ideas forced upon them by bigoted, narrow-minded
 politicians.</p>

<p>I spent 26 years watching the most heterosexual garbage on my tv 
because people like Youngkin thought watching anything queer would turn 
their precious children gay, god forbid that ever happen (<em>eyeroll)</em>.
 Yet here I am, a cis woman, eating pussy like it was made for me. If 
your kid is trans and you let them do what they want, you'll have a 
happy trans kid. If you try to "persuade" your trans kids into being 
cis, you end up with a dead kid.<br>What a child watches or knows about,
 doesn't suddenly change turn them into that thing, but hiding 
information from them is a sure sign you are at the very least 
manipulating your child and what they are allowed to think is "okay". If
 your child is begging teachers not to tell you that they're trans, 
maybe you should reflect on why your child is so scared of you. Children
 should be able to trust that their parents will help them, and be there
 for them, not actively abuse them every time them intentionally use the
 wrong name or tell them they don't know anything.<br>Does no one 
remember what it was like being a child? Didn't you wish you could just 
cuddle with your momma and not worry about anything? Why are you so 
afraid of letting children feel safe within themselves?</p>

<p>Under the bill of rights, every citizen has the right to free speech 
under the first amendment. Children are people and citizens, they have 
the right to express themselves how they feel and the law should not 
impede on that. If a child identifies themselves a different way than 
their birth sex, it is their right. The law should not be involved 
unless it is to protect that right, otherwise it is infringing upon said
 rights. The US is a beautiful country for how we have laws to protect 
self expression, let's not force children into a world where they cannot
 be themselves nor be forced to bow to a temporary state of the ever 
shifting societal norm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children have the right to free speech too. They should be able to 
express themselves however they wish and no law should infringe upon 
that.</p>

<p>This policy is HORRIBLE. Trans children deserve to be affirmed and 
safe in their identity. Youngkin is a hateful person who is ignoring the
 science of trans youth. This policy will absolutely kill people, lead 
to increased suicide in an already vulnerable population, and is rooted 
in fear and hate, not facts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m appalled at the targeting of the vulnerable trans &amp; LGBTQ

<p>They are most likely victims of abuse, not perpetrators. This is the type of action that the Nazis engaged in. Stop it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These policies introduced are going to increase suicide rates of 
children, homelessness rate of children, abuse rates of children, and 
bullying statistics of children. These policies hurt our kids and 
Virginia will do everything we can to stop them.</p>

<p>This policy if enacted will result in dead children. Study after 
study shows that supporting and affirming transgender people, 
particularly children, significantly improves their mental health and 
decreases the likelihood of suicide. This policy does not protect 
anyone, and only insures that trans children with suicidal thoughts will
 not get the help and support they need.</p>

<p>I'm writing to express my strong opposition to rolling back 
protections for trans and binary kids.&nbsp; Please do not let this 
happen. These are some of our most vulnerable students and they deserve 
love and respect as do we all. They deserve to be recognized and

<p>If you don’t know a trans person you shouldn’t even have a hand in 
considering their autonomy. Take a second and ask yourself why you are 
so concerned over dictating someone else’s personal decisions. Do you 
want to be told what religion you have to practice? Do you want to be 
forced to only eat one type of food? Do you want to be told who you are 
allowed to love? Chances are the answer is no. Oppose this harmful 
attempt at FORCING KIDS TO BECOME SUICIDAL. Glenn Youngkin is an 
embarrassment to Virginia, a state that boasts it’s for lovers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My concerns as an educator starts with my students. I am not a 
teacher for parents, I am a teacher for students. I want my students to 
be comfortable and feel safe in the classroom. I have already 
established trust with my trans students, and they know that their 
information is safe with me. If required to ask parents prior to using a
 name or set of pronouns, my students would not be able to be themselves
 in the class, and many would be afraid of repercussions should their 
parents find out. It would be irresponsible and put the lives of 
children at risk should this policy be implemented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an aside, this policy also affects cis children as well as trans 
children. As the policy reads, any child with a nickname "that is not 
commonly associated with their name" (which leaves a lot of wiggle room 
with interpretation. How can I know what is and isn't an associated 
nickname?) who wants to use said nickname in the class, I would be 
required to call their parents and ask if that is okay. Not only is that
 impractical, but it's just nonsense. Requiring parental permission for 
nickname usage has never occurred for cis children, so why is it being 
proposed for trans children?</p>

<p>I'm just horrified that there are actual politicians dictating which 
kids matter - only straight, white, churchy kids matter to you - no one 
else - well maybe they don't matter. Maybe only their parents matter 
because they give you money. &nbsp;Don't worry, if you don't let those 
kids come out because their parents OWN them, that's fine. I'm sure 
they'll be perfectly healthy (sarcasm in case you cannot understand 
that). &nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll sit back in your cushy life watching all of these trans and 
non-binary kids be subject to abuse -yes this is abuse. You claim to be 
supportive of mental health initiatives and you will be causing a MAJOR 
mental health crisis. &nbsp;Not that you all read, but in case you do...

<p>LGBTQ youth are not inherently prone to suicide risk because of their

because of <em><strong>how they are mistreated and stigmatized in society. </strong></em><strong>Thanks for contributing to this Youngkin!</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li style="list-style-type: disc;">Suicide is the second leading cause 
of death among young people aged 10 to 24 (Hedegaard, Curtin, &amp;

<p>I strongly oppose this new 2022 model. I reject that respecting 
students and their personal agency is a hinderance to learning. School 
should be an environment where a student feels safe, seen, and 
appreciated so that they may achieve their full potential. Return to the
 2021 policies. Trans and non-binary kids exist and they should be 
treasured, like all children, by their communities.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>As a gay person who grew up long ago in Virginia public schools, 
supporting ALL students is imperative. If a child is made to feel 
inferior to their peers, especially by the adults tasked with teaching 
and caring for them, that child will most likely develop a host of 
mental and emotional problems. Being transgender is well established 
science, despite what some news organizations might say. It is also well
 established and documented that allowing free expression of however a 
child might be wishing to present themselves is healthy and does no harm
 to their development. Even the medical community agrees that even 
minimum support during puberty for a transgender child is completely 
reversible and does no harm to the child, and in fact helps them grow in
 a more positive way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a parent, I am appalled that school boards and local governments 
around the country are trying to pass rules and laws that directly harm 
children. The parents that are behind these actions are not doing so out
 of any factual issues, but out of fear mongering and bigotry. That has 
absolutely no place in our education system. This is no different than 
the uproar about segregation back in the 1960s, and the white people you
 see in the photos from that time screaming and throwing hatred at the 
black children just trying to attend schools could very well have been 
taken today with transgender children.&nbsp; They are just as ugly now 
as they were then.</p>

<p>This new guidance is a poorly disguised attempt to score political

This policy will lead to the deaths of trans kids, and that blood will 
be on the hands of Youngkin and all his supporters. Leave trans kids

<p>Life is complicated enough, especially for kids trying to understand 
who they are and how they fit into this world of ours. Instead of 
helping them, the Governor's policies will isolate them from their 
community even further. It is an unjust and cruel policy grounded in a 
pursuit of political advantage at the expense of those who most need our
 help.</p>

<p>Less than a decade ago, I was a teenager living in rural northern 
Virginia. I knew fellow children who were regularly beaten for being 
LGBT+ while school staff looked the other way. I watched as many LGBT+ 
teens who didn't have the shield of being popular prior to coming out 
were discussed casually with slurs around lunch tables in hallways. I 
had to sit through a conversation with a well respected teacher and 
writer for the local paper as he described his disgust towards LGBT+ 
people and how they shouldn't be allowed in the military and don't ask 
don't tell shouldn't have ended.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know children who didn't survive. I know people still in the area 
who cannot safely come out as transgender, and are planning on dying 
without telling anyone still in my hometown, because they fear severe 
violence. I myself, left my hometown as soon as I was physically able 
to, and promptly socially transitioned (with medical transition 
following shortly afterwards once I could afford it). I do not plan on 
returning to live there, because I fear severe violence from the 
community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy encourages for a culture of violent anti-LGBT+ rhetoric 
to thrive within schools, and by extension the counties and towns these 
schools serve. It is a joke that it was ever considered as a state 
policy. Those who back it are fully knowledgeable that this policy is 
dangerous for students, but will appease the Christo-fascist voters who 
they want to gain support from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children who wish to by a different name, use different pronouns, 
dress differently, and use restrooms pose no threat to other students. 
Affirming them does them no harm. Affirming students does not harm the 
quality of education being received by their peers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children deserve to be safe at school, many do not have safe homes to

<p>PROTECT LGBT YOUTH! They will be running the country after us. They 
are our future. If you give into the demands of the few, you will be 
opening the doors for discrimination and other biases to enter not only 
schools, but jobs, stores, doctors, etc. You will be ruining any chance

<p>Children are people and have a right to safety and privacy. 
Transgender youth are already at higher risk of abuse and you are 
determined to make it easier for them to be mistreated. The lack of care
 for their well-being and rights reflected in this legislation is 
disgusting and shameful.</p>

<p>This new policy is absolutely abhorrent. Not only is it denying 
protection of our trans students, but forces them to be referred to as 
their deadname and pronouns. Stuff like this is what's killing our trans
 youth. With already rising suicide rates being one of the many causes 
of trans death, this policy will only encourage the students to give up.
 This policy is telling us that we can't be safe in our identity, even 
in school. It's telling trans children that there is no place for them, 
that they don't matter. This will result in many children taking their 
own lives. Supporting this policy is indirect murder of innocent 
lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>I strongly oppose this proposed 2022 VDOE Model 
policies.&nbsp; This proposal would create a hostile and potentially 
dangerous school environment for our VA transgender and nonbinary youth,
 requiring teachers and staff to forcibly “out” students, prohibit staff
 from supporting trans and nonbinary students such as using a students 
affirming name and pronouns, and prohibit access or participation in 
activities consistent with their gender identity.&nbsp; All our students
 deserve a supportive and affirming school environment, especially our 
vulnerable and marginalized populations like our transgender and 
nonbinary youth. Instituting these policies would create a Virginia 
school environment that has specifically removed support opportunities 
for vulnerable children. This is the opposite of small government, this 
is government overreach.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I STRONGLY support the updated 2022 guidelines which return our 
public schools toward sanity when it comes to providing safety and 
privacy for all of our students and ensuring PARENTS have a say in use 
of pronouns and gender identity of their student while in school.&nbsp; 
Both girls and boys deserve to know when entering a school restroom or 
locker room that a person of the opposite biological sex is not in the 
private space.&nbsp; It's just common sense.&nbsp; It has nothing to do 
with denial of rights for kids who are currently gender confused.&nbsp; 
The updated guidelines protect the rights of ALL students, not just 
those seeking a special class under the old 2021 guidelines.&nbsp; In 
addition, I strongly support the update because it protects students 
from accidental mis-gendering and pronoun use or being accused of a hate
 crime for simply referring to someone using their pronoun tied to their
 biological sex assignment at birth.&nbsp; This update aligns with 1) 
the reality that there are only two sexes, male and female; 2) students 
of either sex deserve safe, private places in school; 3) ALL students 
matter - whether considered cis-gender or gender-confused; and 4) female
 student athletes deserve to know their hard work on the court or field 
won't be erased by a member of the opposite sex seeking to steal a 
college scholarship and harming the opportunity afforded to our female 
athletes under Title IX.&nbsp; THANK YOU for bringing VA schools back to
 reality and common sense under these updated guidelines.</p>

<p>We cannot as a society guarantee that all children feel safe in their
 homes but since they're legally required to go to school, all kids 
deserve to feel safe there. Your transphobic "rights of parents," 
rhetoric is going to force more kids into the closet, actively harming 
their mental health when they already have the highest rates of suicide 
among youths. This is culture war nonsense that only pleases bullies in 
power and hurts the vulnerable. Enacting it would be a shameful reversal
 of the progress Virginia has made in the last ten years and a black 
mark on the soul of all involved.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You all act like you care about the children so much, but when those 
children express themselves or use their voices in a way you deem 
invalid, you take their voices away immediately. Feels like you really 
don't care at all so long as they fit into your box. In the end a lot of
 trans CHILDREN commit suicide before they ever even hit adulthood, this
 is well-known information, yet you people insist on erasing their 
identities... How pro-life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am strongly opposed to these proposed restrictions. Especially 
considering that it's an attempt to override democratically installed 
protections. The people of Virginia elected representatives passed these
 protections and Youngkin is trying to dictate, not represent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trans children need protection against hate and discrimination. The 
fact that so many people of power are choosing to target a minority is 
just pathetic.</p>

<p>This is extremely hateful and misguided legislation. It is not based 
in reality or scientific fact. The rate of suicide will increase in 
children and teens because of it. Please look into the rates of 
transgender suicide and the effect of unsupportive legislation and 
people in trans kids' lives.</p>

<p>You aren’t “protecting kids” by making those that know their body 
does not match their view of themselves: you’re making their lives 
miserable. Nobody is aided by this stance, but some are definitely 
harmed by it. What’s worse is this effort is not guided by some high 
minded morality: it is a cheap and cynical political stunt meant to 
rouse the worst in a handful of bigots whom you wish to exploit for 
political gain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enough. Have the decency to respect and support trans youth.</p>

<p>This policy would result in cruel, unfair treatment of trans 
students. ALL students deserve to feel safe and respected at school. 
Trans students' identities are valid and should be treated as 
such.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am a mother with two elementary school-age children in the 
Albemarle County Public School system. I am deeply troubled and sad to 
see VDOE pursue such a misguided and cruel policy for obvious political 
reasons. This is a policy developed by political consultants, not one by
 educators, parents, and public health professionals. I'm sad to see 
VDOE develop a policy to try to score political and ideological points 
with a base that does not represent most voters in Virginia, rather than
 looking out what is best for children.</p>
<p>My school district, ACPS, developed a thoughtful policy with 
wide-ranging input on the treatment of transgendered and gender 
expansive students. This thoughtful policy seeks to support students, 
offering safety and dignity. VDOE's proposed new guidance does the 
opposite.</p>
<p>Please be better than this.</p>

<p>We have seen these policies be enacted before. The suicide rates go 
up, the youth homelessness rates go up, the bullying rates go up, and 
the abuse rates go up. Statistics do not lie, policies that require 
outing of student's identity will result in the death and abuse of 
children. If you actually care about the children of Virginia, do not 
support this policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Children are not born with hate in their heart. They are taught by 
grown ups to bully and behave in hateful ways. Kids in school today are 
incredibly inclusive, despite some parents and governors best efforts to
 teach them to discriminate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This so-called guidance is immoral and sows hate and division in our 
schools. Our kids don't want it and the overwhelming majority of parents
 don't want it. The small minority of cowardly and fearful parents 
pushing for policies like this don't get to make the rules for everyone 
else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hatred and discrimination are manifestations of fear. What are you 
afraid of governor? Are you afraid students will learn to be respectful 
of people that don't look like them, don't pray like them, and don't fit
 YOUR preconceived notions? Is respect, and tolerance, and inclusivity a
 threat to you and your supporters? Are you intent on churning out 
generations of bigots that enter the real world and find that they have 
been gaslighted by the adults making the rules?</p>
<p>It does not hurt grown ups one damn bit to call a student by a 
preferred name. In fact, hundred of thousands of kids in Virginia 
schools go by a nickname different than their full legal name. No one 
asks parents for permission to call a kid Cathy instead of Catherine. 
And no grown up is "harmed" for not being a jerk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your rules are juvenile, harmful, and probably illegal. As a parent I
 vehemently oppose this guidance and will fight it on all levels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transgender and LGBTQ+ kids have not been heard, and this guidance 
endangers them. Growing up is difficult. Growing up transgender and/or 
LGBTQ is even more challenging. Parents do not always support these 
kids, and it is not uncommon that they throw them out of the home. It is
 nothing new that many transgender kids end up homeless, and the suicide
 rate is high. Let them live their lives. I have raised two (now adult) 
children in Virginia public schools. Listen to the kids. They should not
 be political pawns and this model guidance does not solve anything. It 
just makes matters worse.</p>

<p>This is extremely hateful and misguided legislation. It is not based 
in reality or scientific fact. The rate of suicide will increase in 
children and teens because of it. Please look into the rates of 
transgender suicide and the effect of unsupportive legislation and 
people in trans kids' lives.</p>

<p>I am a Chesterfield resident and mother of 4. I vote in every election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I strongly oppose these changes to the guidance for transgender 
students. Study after study shows that transgender youth are at high 
risk for suicide and bullying. These changes just turn the teachers and 
the schools into the bullies. We need to protect our most vulnerable

<p>It is abhorrent that the current administration is stripping away 
policies put in place to protect trans youth. This legislation is not 
about empowering parents, it is about codifying harassment and 
discrimination against young people whose gender doesn't align with 
their sex assigned at birth. These policies extend beyond trans youth, 
they also demonstrate that people who are different and don't conform to
 outdated societal trends don't deserve equal treatment and respect. All
 people are deserve to live whole, happy, and full lives regardless of 
their gender identity. Please protect the mental health and wellbeing of
 all young people and do not codify this discriminatory policy.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose these new guidelines that put trans and non-binary 
children at risk and make them more unsafe. We need to maintain 
protections that affirm ALL children, including trans and non-binary 
children, in order to save lives. Please do not support this retrograde 
approach.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this proposed policy. &nbsp;This proposal would 
create an unwelcoming &nbsp;school environment for VA transgender and 
nonbinary youth. This would require teachers and staff to forcibly “out”
 students, prohibit staff from supporting trans and nonbinary students, 
and prohibit students from participating in school &nbsp;activities that
 consistent with their gender identity. &nbsp;All students deserve a 
supportive and affirming school environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>transgender students deserve the same love, understanding, and 
respect that cisgender students receive, especially in the classroom. 
tired of people seeing transgender people as a threat to society, and 
outcasting children via adopting these policies is so remarkably 
disgusting. if parents are really <em>that&nbsp;</em>afraid of their 
children learning about LGBT people and topics, they should learn how to
 teach and homeschool them themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reading over the whole proposal:</p>
<p>it puts an end to discrimination/harassment of any/all students. That
 means trans or not. Contrary to what is purveyed out in the media, 
teens who have detransitioned indicated they got a lot of support being 
trans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>it requires parents, who are constitutionally responsible for their 
offspring in every way, to consent to counseling services. Considering 
schools are not able to dispense medications without parental consent, 
this is consistent. It also requires them to consent to name/pronoun 
changes so they are again in charge of their offspring, having the right
 to raise them with the values they see fit, and not some agenda pushing
 public employee. This allows for freedom of speech for teachers to not 
agree - and something that any human has to get used to as not everyone 
is going to agree with your choices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>mandating safe spaces for each sex is provided for, thereby 
eliminating half of the student population that is upset enough to not 
go to the bathroom during school due to fear of the opposite sex coming 
in, also due to the rapes/sodomies that occurred, whereby school 
officials covered up the violence and allowed it to happen again. This 
includes other areas that could be used to violate half the student 
population.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this guidance change. All individuals should be

hurt trans kids and strip them of the little support they currently 
receive. This guidance change will kill trans kids. Oppose this guidance
 change and save lives.</p>

<p>Transgender kids are human beings! Help them.</p>
<p>No amount of "re-programming", "re-education", or any religious ritual is going to change who they are.</p>
<p>The idea of state government intervention is fascist autocracy by 
power-hungry people with small minds terrified they are no longer in the
 majority thus must lash out and be loud, obnoxious bullies.</p>
<p>That is neither constructive nor democratic, thus un-American. The 
MAJORITY of citizens will decide, NOT Gov. Youngkin &amp; loud minority.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the forcible outing of trans students to ANYONE 
they do not consent to telling. I strongly oppose banning trans students
 from using bathrooms and sports that align with their chosen gender. 
This bill/policy is state sponsored bigotry and an attempt to destroy 
what little trans folks there are. It will directly cause children to 
die, whether it he by suicide, the hands of abusive parents, or the 
hands of abusive peers. STOP TARGETING MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the Youngkin administration's proposed changes to 
the Model Policy. The proposed policies are hateful and harmful to 
LGBTQIA+ students, and all community members. There is no reason why 
queer students should not be able to live openly in their school 
community if they choose to do so. Mental health and medical providers, 
as well as educators, already know that anti-trans and homophobic 
policies and laws directly cause harm to these children. It is 
outrageous that this administration would target a vulnerable population
 for political gains.</p>
<p>The policy is unnecessary to protect parents' rights because parents 
already have rights in their children's educations. It is a lie when 
they say that parents are cut out of the public school system. If 
parents want to be involved they can start by talking to their own kids 
and their kids' teachers. They can view all educational materials on 
line or in person at schools. They can review policies on line. They can
 attend PTA meetings, parent teacher conferences, and school board 
meetings. In the many years my children have attended public schools, 
when I have reached out to teachers or administrators, the responses 
have been open and transparent (even if I did not necessarily like the 
outcome).</p>
<p>The policy literally asks school boards to violate the law by 
enforcing unconstitutional discrimination against transgender students. 
For example, the 4th Circuit's decision in the Grimm case explicitly 
held that schools must allow students to use the restroom of their 
identified gender, and yet this policy states the opposite. 
Conservatives claim to be for law and order, but this policy explicitly 
violates the law.</p>
<p>This policy is using vulnerable students as political pawns before an
 extremely important election. Youngkin's attempt during the 2021 
election to paint himself as the nice guy Republican has been completed 
debunked by his recent actions. This policy is not for the betterment of
 Virginia's schools or to support Virginia's students or parents. It is 
political pandering. The Model Policies should be rejected.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the VA Department of Education's Guidance on the 
treatment of transgender youth. In defiance of state law, this policy 
does not follow evidence-based practices and puts our children at risk. 
Trans youth are nearly four times as likely to have attempted suicide as
 the population of secondary school students as a whole (see chart below
 with recent data for Fairfax County). It is only a wanton disregard for
 the lives of these children that policies can be promulgated that 
isolate these children even more than they already are.&nbsp; It has 
been shown that even one supportive teacher or adult can make a 
difference in the life of a child. The teacher has a duty to the child 
not the parent.</p>
<p>A sane bathroom policy would be to allow children to use the bathroom
 that conforms to their gender identity and then have a separate 
bathroom for anyone who is uncomfortable with that. Sports should be 
left to sports organizations. Certainly nothing below the high school 
level should even be an issue. It simply is not that important when 
weighed against the welfare of a VERY small group of children.</p>
<p>Schools are government institutions, and school employees should not 
be able to impose their religious beliefs on their students or even 
articulate them as part of their role as a government employee. 
Separation of church and state is a fundamental tenet of our republic. 
If a teacher finds a particular student's identify offends their 
religion, then accommodations for that teacher should be made by 
transferring the teacher to another school or otherwise limiting their 
interaction with these children. The child should not be exposed to any 
harmful or disrespectful interactions. Name calling is bullying. Using a
 "dead' name is name-calling.</p>
<p>You may score political points for these heartless policies, but the blood of these children will be on your hands.</p>

<p>Trans kids need support from the adults in their lives and in their 
government. Every bit of research shows that supporting trans kids 
prevents suicides. They are biologically trans and deserve to be 
recognized for who they are. The future is LGBTQ supportive and the 
present is strong enough to fight bills like this. These kids will 
continue to be their authentic selves and deserve legal protection from 
hatred, bigotry, and actions that otherwise cause suicide.</p>

<p>Targeting any population of kids and singling them out is cruel. Our 
job as adults and parents is to protect every kid in our community. If 
Youngkin wants to listen to parents, how about listening to the parents 
of this vulnerable population of trans kids. No parent wants their child
 to feel ostracized, harrased and alienated.</p>

<p>This is a deliberate distraction, proving Youngkin isn't interested 
in doing his job, isn't interested in Public Service or 
governance.&nbsp; We need to address the most basic school issues:&nbsp;
 teacher pay and availability, overcrowded schools, better supplies so 
teachers don't have to pay out of pocket to run their classes, and the 
need to help kids who are less well off with decent school lunches and 
social support services.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Youngkin instead appears to be chasing around the country trying to 
promote his own political career, and his latest tactic is attacking the
 most vulnerable kids in Virginia, a tiny percentage of the school 
population. Meanwhile, the tiny percentage of MAGA Republican parents 
who enthusiastically support this cruelty are literally burning books 
and complaining about CRT--a racist dog whistle, if there ever was one. 
What a bloody waste of our time.</p>
<p>This is an attempt to force our Public Schools into serving a tiny 
minority's narrow view of the world, a view formed by a single religion,
 which our Constitution clearly states has no place in government--and 
by extension our public schools. All religions are welcome in our 
country because our founders saw the consequences of forcing one 
religion on others.</p>
<p>Neutrality and equity in treatment of kids--all kids--is absolutely 
required in our public schools. Focus on the basics.&nbsp; Are they 
healthy, are they learning basic skills, are they prepared to contribute
 to our society? Anything else is political pandering.</p>

Trans and non-binary youth suicide and depression rates are very high, 
and this motion will cause that number to increase in Virginia. Being 
trans or non-binary is not a choice, it is that individuals true 
identity. People close to trans and non-binary youth should be able to 
affirm their gender without consequence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First of all, discrimination against transgender individuals is <strong>illegal discrimination</strong> on the basis of sex.</p>
<p>Secondly, restricting the rights of transgender students is morally 
repugnant. It will do harm to these students who the schools should be 
helping protect and nurture so that they may grow into their best 
selves. Their gender/name/pronoun choices are not hurting anyone else. 
They should be supported and loved. Not all parents support their 
children's choices, and the consequences can be catastrophic. Why would 
we want to create a policy that may cause children to be kicked out of 
their homes or even worse? This Pollyanna idea that everyone has perfect
 parents who will love them no matter what is ridiculous and 
unrealistic. If children are not out to their parents, it just may be 
for a very good reason. Not all homes are safe havens. But our schools 
should be for ALL students.</p>
<p>The idea that teachers can ignore pronoun preferences etc based on 
their own beliefs is unbelievable and certainly sides with right-wing 
religious extremists. If a teacher doesn't believe a woman should have a
 career, can they then choose to not respect the girls in their class 
and only teach them cooking and cleaning? Should the biology teacher get
 to choose to teach creationism because that's what their church tells 
them? I don't care what a teacher's "beliefs" are. Respect every child 
in the class. Period. Protect every child in the class. Period.</p>
<p>I believe this policy singles out one small segment of the population
 and makes it OK to discriminate against them based on a phony problem. 
There is no evidence that trans students are causing any kinds of 
problems in schools. And hiding our students from real world 
complexities, which include gender, is not educating them. It's 
indoctrinating them to one ideology.</p>
<p>I keep hearing about "parents rights." Children should have rights, 
too. And feeling safe and supported at school should be foremost among 
them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What will happen by having trans people be outted &amp; banning them 
from self-expression is that you are going to make harassment easier for
 them &amp; thus it will lead to attempted suicides across your state. 
If you don't want that on your conscious or your hands, then don't pass 
this law</p>

<p>This guidance document directly violates the protections from 
discrimination against gender identities codified in the Virginia Values
 Act. Not only is it would be illegal for schools to adopt such a policy
 in direct violation of it, but it would also cause a endanger our youth
 and educators in the LGBT community by putting their privacy and 
freedom of speech and expression at risk, as well as encourage the abuse
 of LGBT children in abusive households and in our institutions. It is 
my strong recommendation that this guidance document should be opposed 
and discarded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Strongly opposed to new guidelines proposed by Youngkin. It is a 
cruel inhumane political stunt that will adversely impact young people 
who are already dealing with enormous pressures in their lives. Focus 
should be on ensuring young people are safe at school which also 
includes not being shot while they are there.</p>

<p>This policy will be hell on students, trans and non-trans alike. Why 
waste school resources trying to interrogate and police student's 
identities? All it would do is create an atmosphere of fear and 
persecution, make both school and home life living hell for Trans kids 
still in the closet, and lead to even more bullying and teen suicides as
 a result.</p>
<p>Being trans is not a choice and it's not a fad - trans kids are kids,
 and just like everyone else they need a safe environment to learn, 
socialize, and experience life free from fear of being ostracized or 
persecuted.</p>

<p>All children deserve to be safe in their homes. We must trust kids to
 determine who are the unsafe people in their lives. The schools must 
protect children by respecting the wishes of students in respect to who 
they don’t feel are the safe adults in their lives.</p>
<p>My first memories in life are of my insides not matching the body 
parts I was born with. In the 1980s there were no books or TV shows 
“making” me feel this way. I didn’t even have the words to describe what
 I was understanding about myself as a toddler. I just knew that they 
way I was inside didn’t match what people saw outside.</p>
<p>I often hear that God doesn’t make mistakes. He didn’t make a mistake
 with me. He made my insides not quite match my outside. To interfere 
with that is to go against God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it necessary for schools and the government to protect children 
who are like me. We need to be protected from family and friends who 
would injure us for God’s choice to make us non-binary or transgender. 
We are very capable of understanding who is a danger to us for being 
non-binary or transgender. Schools most trust our instincts about the 
evil people around us. We don’t all have loving and supportive parents. 
Some of us have parents to squash our spirits and steal our 
childhoods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call kids what they want to be called. If it isn’t an issue to call 
William by the name “Bill”, then there is no reason to object to calling
 me Blake or Susan or Sissy or Bubba. Names are just a word we respond 
to.</p>

<p>Being a kid is hard. It's already difficult to navigate changing 
bodies, peer pressure, school work, extracurricular activities, and just
 figuring out who you are and what you stand for. But kids who feel that
 who they are isn't reflected in their physical sex have it so much 
harder, especially when state-sanctioned discrimination tells them that 
the way they feel is not valid, and therefore WHO THEY ARE is not valid.
 Our society should be one of love and understanding and inclusion, not 
one of fear and bullying. Tell our kids that being different is okay as 
long as you're true to yourself. Anything else leads to self hatred and 
self harm, and our kids deserve better.</p>

<p>This state will lose so much money if you enact the policy. People 
will move away and it’ll be all your fault. Have fun going down in 
history as the worst state governor we’ve had yet, which is a pretty 
hard task to accomplish considering our former governor literally did 
blackface. You’re a sick individual for even suggesting this. Please 
seek your own mental health counseling to unlearn transphobic beliefs. 
You will feel better emotional from seeing a trans-affirming mental 
healthcare professional, lol. Red is dying, Republicans are losers.</p>

<p>As a parent of a student in the Arlington Public School system, I 
strongly oppose this policy. All students have the right to learn in an 
environment that is free from harassment and discrimination, that 
includes discrimination based upon sex. This policy is it discriminatory
 and has no place in Virginia or Virginia’s schools. The very nature of 
this policy will not only have a chilling effect on students but will 
have a severe negative effect on LGBTQIA+ students who are already an 
extremely vulnerable community. Virginia’s children should be protected 
not persecuted.</p>

<p>Thank you for the proposed regulations which provide care and 
attention to children with sex confusion/dysphoria while respecting all 
students' mental and physical health and the important role of parents. 
&nbsp;Parents are the people who know and love their children best, and 
should be involved in all decisions and actions taken at school 
regarding their children. The prior regulations shut parents out. The 
proposed regulations correct this, to the benefit of all children! Thank
 you Governor Youngkin and the Education team!&nbsp;</p>

 the hysteria and focus on the issues that actually have a serious 
effect on citizens of not only Virginia but the US as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the implementation of this guidance document. As a 
mental health professional, I have worked with a number of transgender 
youth and children, and I can unequivocally say that those who did not 
have the support of their parents, friends, and school communities 
experienced more severe mental illness symptoms, up to and including 
suicidal thoughts and attempts. Parents do not always support their 
trans children, nor do they always act in their child’s best interests. 
Even one supportive adult can make a big difference in a child’s life, 
but if teachers and school personnel are prevented by the state 
government from providing that support, the outlook for numerous 
children will be bleak indeed.</p>

<p>How will this address teacher burnout? How will this help school 
funding? How will this address any loss of learning due to covid? How 
will this make kids feel safer in school? How will this promote 
acceptance? How will this solve teacher shortages across the state? How 
will this solve long bus rides and bus driver shortages? How will this 
promote inclusion?&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>This doesn’t address actual school issues, it’s just political pandering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OPPOSE- THROW IT OUT.</p>
<p>This is literally laughable- this policy <strong>actively </strong>works
 against every current mental health and medical guideline (supported by
 actual research) about how to build policy related to trans kids/the 
treatment of trans kids.</p>
<p>Though I guess that's apparent when the policy defines sex and not 
gender or even transgender, just "a transgender student," and actively 
misgenders a transgender person in the additional laws section- making 
the bias of the policy writer pretty clear.</p>
<p>It's interesting how much this policy talks about protecting 
"parent's rights," as if they would somehow be undermined by a more 
reasonable policy that would actually protect transgender children- I 
cannot fathom how a basic acknowledgment that transgender people exist 
at all and can be treated with the absolute most basic, ground floor 
level of human decency and passing respect- even if you don't like them-
 would somehow take away parents role as the primary people raising 
their child. Should we also stop teaching kids to ask before trying to 
grab something out of another person's hand, to not hit each other, or 
other basic social skills?? After all- that might not be how it's done 
in their house!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the "Maintenance of a safe and supportive learning environment 
free from discrimination and harassment for all students" section, this 
policy seeks to state:</p>
<p>The [School Division] prohibits all discrimination, harassment, and 
bullying based on actual national origin, race, religion, sex, 
disability, <strong>political beliefs,</strong> or any other characteristic protected by law.</p>
<p>Honestly incredible, to specifically include political beliefs (not 
protected by law!) and NOT expand that sex also includes gender identity
 and sexuality (protected by law!)</p>
<p>Also, for a policy that mentions bullying so many times, the plan to prevent harassment and bullying could not be more vague</p>
<p>Overall- this is possibly the worst policy I have seen, and I would 
never allow any child of mine to be in any school that applied it, and 
if it is not scrapped or completely redone, I feel honestly heartbroken 
for any kids in a school that does apply it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such laws can lead to hatred and violence that is covered up and 
legally okay. If you want a word where violence isn’t the answer, maybe 
don’t allow for violence to become the normal. Ignoring this community 
does not make them any less real.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite any concern for children on may bring up in support of this 
policy, it’s been clear for years that this opens up hatred, bullying, 
and discrimination against any child who may not fit with what society 
says is Heterosexual at the time. We have proven that these practices 
only cause HARM and any potential benefit it has is overshadowed by 
immediate damage caused by isolation and discrimination. Trans kids need
 more aid not punishment out of paranoid unfounded fears. This witch 
hunt against trans people is an assault on US citizens. “A lack of 
policies and practices that affirm and support LGBT youth—and a failure 
to implement protections that do exist—means that LGBT students 
nationwide continue to face bullying, exclusion, and discrimination in 
school, putting them at physical and psychological risk and limiting 
their education.</p>
<p>In 2001, Human Rights Watch published&nbsp;<em>Hatred in the Hallways: Violence and Discrimination against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Students in US Schools</em>.
 The report documented rampant bullying and discrimination against LGBT 
students in schools across the country, and urged policymakers and 
school officials to take concrete steps to respect and protect the 
rights of LGBT youth.” © 2016 Mariam Dwedar for Human Rights Watch</p>

<p>Allowing parents and the school board to make the decision is like 
the states rights to slavery or states rights during segregation: very 
few will do it without it being a state or national thing, and many 
people will be hurt because of the lack of action to make schools teach 
and accept trans and nonbinary children.&nbsp; This new policy will kill
 kids and traumatized many more.</p>
<p>This is a bodily autonomy issue</p>
<p>This is a gender presentation issue.</p>
<p>This will not protect kids.</p>

<p>As a licensed professional counselor and counselor educator with a 
large public institution in the state, I STRONGLY OPPOSE the guidance 
being suggested by Gov. Youngkin. A recent study by the Trevor Project 
found that 45% of LGBTQIA+ youth have strongly considered attempting 
suicide in the past year, with BIPOC youth reporting even higher 
numbers. Students who report having a safe and affirming school 
environment report lower rates of suicide than their peers who report 
having hostile ones. Furthermore, less than 1 out of 3 transgender and 
non-binary students report having a safe and affirming home environment -
 which makes having a safe school environment imperative to their 
wellbeing. The policies suggested by Gov. Youngkin will put all LGBTQIA+
 youth at continued risk for mental health issues like depression, 
anxiety, and suicide. Mandating these new policies will harm trans 
youth. VA should be supporting all students, especially trans students. 
Schools have an obligation to protect all students.</p>

<p>Governor Youngkin, I understand that you and I will see eye-to-eye on
 almost nothing, but I am going to give you credit for some level of 
humanity. Ask yourself: if this policy were written about middle-aged 
white men, limiting their rights and implying that they are second-class
 citizens, would you have proposed it? Treat others as you wish to be 
treated, and withdraw this policy immediately.</p>

<p>Under Purpose of the proposed policy it states "All Students have the
 right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, 
harassment, or bullying. Yet after feeling safe in school after 
implementation of the 2021 Model Policies the new GOP administration 
seeks to fix something that is not broken due to its own ideology that 
being transgender is wrong. This new policy will in no uncertain terms 
make trans students feel, in fact they will be, discriminated against, 
harassed, and bullied by classmates and teachers as authorized by the 
State of Virginia. This policy if allowed in public schools will make 
the life of trans students much, much worse and will likely lead to 
increased suicidal ideation in transgender students. Do not implement 
this proposed policy.</p>

<p>As a mental health provider I find the rollback on supportive 
policies for trans and non-binary youth abhorrent. &nbsp;We are in the 
midst of a youth mental health crisis and yet our current governor is 
supporting a policy that is dangerous and will likely cause significant 
mental health challenges for trans and non-binary young people. &nbsp;In
 studies examining mental health challenges for these kids we see over 
and over again that factors that promote resiliency and show a positive 
mental health impact are parent connectedness, social support, school 
safety and belonging, and the ability to use one’s chosen name. 
&nbsp;This is a policy that will cause significant harm and which 
benefits no one. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We all have a right to be who we are, to choose our life.&nbsp; Young
 people are no exception.&nbsp; They need the freedom to develop a true,
 healthy identity, not coercion to conform to a harmful political agenda
 put forth by an absentee governor concerned more with his bid to become
 the presidential nominee of an extreme MAGA party than in his 
stewardship of the Commonwealth of Virginia and all of its people.&nbsp;
 This is another regressive example of Republicans attempting to take 
away our freedoms in their quest to gain control and power while harming
 a segment of our population that needs affirmation, not condemnation, 
of who they are. This policy is very harmful in its unintended 
consequences for trans youth and their families.&nbsp; Don't be fooled 
by Republican rhetoric, lies, distractions, and manipulation. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Introducing a law that could potentially put trans children in danger
 is absolute horseradish. This is ridiculous. There are probably only 14
 trans kids going into this school, and making it so that they have to 
be outed to their families who may not support them only puts these kids
 in danger. The 2021 model policy seemed just perfectly fine. It offered
 guidance on how to handle trans kids and it gave them the agency to 
handle their identity in the best way. This new policy is only going to 
open the door up for further harassment. There are homes out there that 
would be especially cruel and hostile to trans kids, and those kids need
 a place where they can feel safe and comfortable. They are going to 
school for an education, not to feel that they are in danger or that 
they’re in some big war zone. The schools need to be the safest possible
 environment possible for those kids, so that they can focus on getting a
 good education. These kids don’t need the schools or the government to 
go sticking their dirty fingers into their private lives because some 
misguided politicians think that they know best. This is ridiculous. 
It’s ghoulish. The teachers are there to teach not act like the trans 
snopes, out to nark on random kids. Keep your hands out of these kids 
privacy and let them make the best decisions for their own safety. Got 
that?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 2022 draft policies will erase trans and non-binary youth from 
the classroom and create a hostile and even dangerous school 
environment. They restrict restroom access and sports participation for 
transgender and nonbinary students, require faculty and staff to “out” 
trans and nonbinary students to their parents, and prohibit teachers and
 staff from supporting trans students in a range of ways, including 
blocking them from using a student’s affirming name and pronouns. 
Further, to require such parental notification even for the student's 
choice of a nickname is absurd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, all parents should be confident that our laws will ensure 
their children’s safety, protection, and freedom. But the Virginia 
Department of Education proposes to reject those values and to advance a
 policy that would target trans and non-binary kids for bullying and 
mistreatment just because of who they are. It is well-known and 
understood that some, if not many parents will abuse or even reject 
children who are "outed" by their teachers, school counselors or 
administrators.</p>
<p>I implore you to reject this proposal and either retain the previous 
version or revise the proposed draft to protect our trans youth from 
possible harm.</p>

<p>I do not know why people feel the need to target and victimize a 
group of people already suffering from more pressure and fear than 
regulators could possibly understand. It is incomprehensible to 
purposely enact rules that will lead to more harm, more mental anguish, 
and perhaps inevitably more suicides. Rules like this that claim to 
support parents in full ignorance of their children reduce these kids to
 mere automatons and deny them of any agency in their own lives. That is
 simply not how it works. Were you just perfect little angels void of 
any character until suddenly you were a person at 18? I hardly think so.
 This is such a grossly unthought out policy with the sole goal of 
making sure people who can't possibly defend themselves suffer the most 
for your homophobia. It is disgusting, it is reprehensible, and it 
leaves bad mark on the state I have had the fortune to grow up in.&nbsp;

<p>I’m someone who figured out they were trans in high school. I had no 
resources and felt like I could not be open. I couldn’t use the right 
bathroom, and no one used my name or terms.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>That was 4 years ago, things have changed, they shouldn’t still be this way.</p>

<p>This policy would be nothing more than government mandated bullying 
of one of the most marginalized and already attacked groups in schools. 
The end goal of all of this is to turn public schools into 
pseudo-private schools where authoritarian teachers and politicians who 
have never been around children in their lives to exert their weird 
fantasies on a group that is mandated to spend 7 hours each day under 
their control. This policy protects no one but politician's paychecks 
coming in from charter schools.</p>

<p>I vehemotly oppose this new guidance. Younkin and his ilk are playing
 an idiotic political game with REAL peoples' lives. This policy is not 
only wrong, it's against the law.</p>
<p>Recent federal court decisions have upheld protections for transgender people, including a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>2020 U.S. Supreme Court decision, written by&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" x="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/neil-gorsuch-gay-transgender-rights-supreme-court/2020/06/16/112f903c-afe3-11ea-8f56-63f38c990077_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_9" target="_blank">Trump appointee</a>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" x="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/neil-gorsuch-gay-transgender-rights-supreme-court/2020/06/16/112f903c-afe3-11ea-8f56-63f38c990077_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_9" target="_blank">Neil M. Gorsuch</a>, that determined that civil rights law barring sex discrimination covers transgender people.</p>
<p>Virginia also has a&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" x="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-human-rights-act/" target="_blank">Human Rights Act</a>&nbsp;that bars discrimination in schools based on gender identity.</p>
<p>Ya'll talk all this crap about protecting kids then literally attack 
everyone not white, cis, and christian while screaming freedom and small
 government. Maybe look in the mirror and deal with your own hatred 
instead of taking it out on kids just trying to survive and be 
themselves.</p>

<p>This is cruel and disgusting. Children need supportive people in 
their lives and schools should be a part of that support. It's abusive 
to ban children from expressing themselves and outing transgender 
children can and will result in parents physically abusing those 
children.</p>

<p>Irreparable harm will be done to children if you do not support the 
right for children and their parents to choose the right path forward 
for them. Do not bring politics into the world of medicine and gender 
affirmation. When did the Republican party become the party that 
tramples on our rights? When did the Republican party become the party 
that believes in government intervention into our right to choose what 
is best for our children and to allow others the right to their choice? 
This policy shift will harm children and open them to discrimination 
that could be prevented by protecting them and their right to choose. 
This policy is shameful and misdirected. As the parent of a transgender 
child I do not agree with this and will work every day to make sure this
 policy is never implemented and that those responsible for these 
dictatorial, intrusive ideas about government intervention are never 
elected again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no evidence that the trans population poses a significant 
risk to women, or anyone for that matter. As for their own sake, it is 
far more dangerous to suppress a child’s gender identity than it is to 
allow them to explore and find who they really are. Bills like this one 
don’t prevent trans people from existing; all they do is force children 
into a life they don’t want or need, and drive them to a state of 
confusion and anguish. They will still be here, and they will still be 
trans. The only difference will be that you made them suffer, and this 
is why 41% of trans people attempt suicide. Allowing students to 
socially transition&nbsp;<em>will</em> save lives.</p>

<p>This rollback directly threatens student both student safety and 
academic achievement by outing students against their will (opening them
 up to potential harassment and abuse) and denying them access to 
restrooms. The latter has been clearly linked with both health issues 
and negative educational outcomes: Herman (2013) found that 10% of 
surveyed trans students who attended school in DC had their education 
negatively affected by lack of access to restrooms and 54% reported 
health issues direct related to lack of restroom access. Trans students,
 like all students, deserve both privacy and safety.</p>

<p>Why are Republicans so cruel? There is absolutely no reason to do 
this. Trans kids who are so vulnerable deserve support and treatment. 
Yet Virginia’s governor seems to spend all his time trying to find ways 
to hurt the most vulnerable instead of standing up for them, why?</p>

<p>Re: "Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in 
Virginia’s Public Schools" I fully support children having the rights to
 live in a way that makes sense for them. I expect adults around them to
 respect their wishes in the way any adult would expect to be respected.
 I reject Youngkin's policies related to transgender students, which 
contribute to the extremely high rates of depression and suicide among 
transgender youth and young adults. Rights for transgender youth is 
suicide prevention and help them thrive as productive adults in society.
 Youngkin's policies have no place in the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>

<p>LGBTQ youth are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide 
than their peers. LGBTQ youth are not inherently prone to suicide risk 
because of their sexual orientation or gender identity but rather placed
 at higher risk because of how they are mistreated and stigmatized in 
society. It's horrific that any elected leader would seek to place these
 children's lives at even greater risk to further a hateful culture war.

<p>I oppose this cruel proposal that appeases and panders to the

 empirically determined to be subjected to higher rates of bullying and 
physical harm as well as having higher rates of suicide than others 
their age. &nbsp;If implemented, this proposal will worsen these 
problems. &nbsp;The statutory authority for this proposal is also 
unclear. &nbsp;What an odd proposal for someone who professes to be a

<p>I am strongly opposed. This is horrific and wrong and I can tell you 
first hand having worked with students from pre-K through college, this 
language is absolutely not in the best interests of our youth. 
Invalidating something as fundamental as identity will cost the lives of
 kids already struggling to find themselves. As a teacher, I will ALWAYS
 respect my students’ chosen names and pronouns. The governor should be 
focused far less on the biological sex organs of minors that aren’t his 
own children and stop interfering and undermining the work teachers are 
doing. STAY IN YOUR LANE YOUNGKIN. We are the ones supporting and 
shaping young minds, we lead with love, respect and understanding. We 
value bodily autonomy and the right to be and explore your authentic 
self. Trans and non-binary kids deserve the same opportunity and freedom
 as other children to be who they are. We will not sit by quietly and 
allow the government to keep policing OUR bodies and OUR lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am strongly opposed to this new guidance. It will lead to increased
 harm for an already vulnerable community. We should be helping 
children, not harming them. Suicide rates for trans students are already
 too high and this guidance will only make it worse. It is harmful and 
mean. Please reject this.</p>

<p>Strongly oppose, grew up and just graduated from a high school in VA.
 Do not do this to kids who need support. School is the only place some 
can get it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bullying at-risk and marginalized students is cruel and inhumane. 
This policy is a harmful waste of time and resources - please focus 
efforts on useful endeavors like teacher recruitment and retention.</p>

<p>(copy/pasted from my email to the governor. tw// suicide, cw// abortion, religion, &amp; transphobia mentions.)</p>
<p>Did you know that 40% of all transgender individuals attempt suicide in their lifetimes?</p>
<p>As of 2022, about 1.5 million Americans identify as transgender--that's 640,000 lives on the line.<br>The CDC reports that in 2019, 629,898 people had abortions.<br>By these data, the transgender suicide rate nationwide is overall higher than the abortion rate.<br>I
 don't understand how you can look the other way as 640,000 innocent 
people end their lives over something they cannot control, but fight to 
keep the number of abortions at 0.</p>
<p>I am asking you to keep reading. This is a difficult pill to swallow,
 but ignoring this email is the difference between life and death for 
some trans people. Are you willing to risk their lives?</p>
<p>The lives of children?</p>
<p>According to the National Library of Medicine, "The present study 
examines the influence of intervenable risk factors [...] and protective
 factors: school belonging, family support, and peer support on both 
lifetime suicide attempts and past 6-month suicidality in a sample of 
transgender youth (n = 372)." This sentence explains that one of the 
major variables NLM studied was the impact of school belonging on 
transgender youth, indicating that it has a significant effect on them. 
It's not possible to determine the individual specific cause of suicide 
for every transgender person, of course, but we can deduce that school 
belonging has a large impact on transgender lives.</p>
<p>Beyond the statistics, I have had personal experiences with suicide and suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>When I first suspected I may be transgender, I prayed to God every chance I could to take the thoughts away.</p>
<p>He did not.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I've considered killing myself because of my 
gender identity before. I have been given a suicide action plan. Your 
laws will only condemn me and hundreds of thousands of other transgender
 youth to pain at school and an increased risk of committing suicide.</p>

<p>I am a senior transgender woman who helps all ages of those 
transitioning as well as assisting parents who have reached out to me 
for guidance to help their children. In my years of transitioning many 
years ago I was shunned, harassed, refused service, discriminated of job
 opportunities and told I should take my own life as there is no place 
for people like me.</p>
<p>The draft of Governor Youngkin's transgender policy will continue the
 discrimination, harassment, the mental, physical and emotional stress 
of the next generation. When will the common decency of allowing all 
individuals live as they wish, be accepted?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I strongly oppose the draft policy and ask each and every one of you,
 what would happen if you had to live with these degrading and senseless
 policies if you or a family member were transgender, non-binary or any 
other gender that did not fit the governor's normal person definition.</p>
<p>Will you be able to live with yourself if one or more young 
individuals can't take the pressure, harassment etc and take their life 
as so many transgenders and others have done in the past due to the 
hatred of allowing them to live their lives.</p>
<p>PLEASE don't allow this draft policy to take effect.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>This bill is not only offensive to trans kids, it is both actively 
harmful and dangerous! Forcefully outing trans kids could subject them 
to abuse both at school and at home. As we know the high rate of 
suicidal ideation amongst transgender folk, we also know that 
legislation like this only causes that statistic to rise! If you really,
 truly, cared for the children, you'd see that this barbaric bill is not
 showing of your care and is instead hate filled and lacks and 
scientific or moral backing.</p>

<p>Parents have rights and according to the Virginia constitution, 
parental rights trump educators who want to hide things from parents.</p>
<p>Allowing boys to compete as girls is a violation of Title IX and a slap in the face to every female athlete.</p>

<p>This policy is a step in the right direction. It could be stronger to
 prevent schools from promoting child mutilation and chemical castration
 (aka "gender affirming care"), but it's a great step to acknowledging 
parental constitutional rights and protecting children from the harmful 
trans ideology.&nbsp; Thank you for looking out for the welfare of VA 
kids and protecting parental rights!</p>

<p>LGBTQ+ kids aren’t going anywhere, as much as you may try to erase 
their identities. Just because some people are uncomfortable with 
other’s sense of self doesn’t mean it will cease to exist if we will it 
so. That is insane, and frankly, an uneducated thought process. All this
 does is lead to depression and lack of feeling like they are valued as 
people. Policies like this are the reason that suicide rates for LGBTQ+ 
teens are so high. This is not the Virginia we know. Children are not 
disposable and most certainly not to be used for political pawns! 
Disgusting behavior!! Youngkin should be ashamed to be promoting this 
rhetoric.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the values of this country, we must protect the freedom 
of children to express themselves however they see fit. This will allow 
them to grow with confidence and become the world leaders we want to see
 tomorrow. Restricting them will only backlash and introduce suffering 
where no one wins. Protect freedom of expression!</p>

<p>Every major health organization agrees that providing children with 
care that affirms their gender identity is the best for the child: care 
includes the way they're treated publicly. Why would you ignore every 
major health organization?&nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy seeks to violate the dignity of transgender students for 
the sake of propping up backwards beliefs about parental rights. 
Children are not properly, they are not things for adults to project 
onto and abuse for the sake of propping up prejudice. Children have a 
right to grow in an environment of&nbsp;peace, dignity, tolerance, 
freedom, equality, and solidarity- an environment that encourages 
confidence in themselves and the right to express themselves freely. 
Transgender children have a right to a safe and supporting environment 
fostered by their peers and their teachers, especially when that is 
often denied to them at home.</p>
<p>I strongly oppose this proposal and everything it stands for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this proposed policy. This proposal would create a 
hostile and potentially dangerous school environment for our VA 
transgender and nonbinary youth. It will require teachers and staff to 
forcibly “out” students. It will prohibit staff from supporting trans 
and nonbinary students, such as using a student's affirming name and 
pronouns. It will prohibit access or participation in activities 
consistent with their gender identity.&nbsp; All our students deserve a 
supportive and affirming school environment.</p>

<p>These proposed policies require teachers to forcibly out transgender 
students to their parents or guardians. This is a dangerous practice as 
it may cause physical, mental, and/or emotional harm to a student if 
their parents or guardians are unsupportive. If you want to protect 
trans students, this policy needs to be removed. Additionally, trans 
students should be allowed to use the proper bathrooms. For example, 
trans men should be permitted to use the men’s restroom.</p>

<p>I agree that all people regardless of sexual identity be able to

be respected in school and be socially accepted.&nbsp; I want equity in 
the schools and these proposals will take all of that away.&nbsp; Please
 consider the fact that every child has the right to be respected and 
has the right to express themselves regardless of gender status.</p>

<p>I completely support Youngkin's new guidance for schools. Parents 
have the right to know what is going on with their children. I have 
always disagreed with the idea that a child can go to school and be a 
completely different person from the one they are at home. It is wrong 
for schools and teachers to "hide" information from parents. Parents 
have a right to know what their children are doing in school, from their
 grades to their friends to everything. How can a mother or father or 
grandparent effectively parent their child without the knowledge of what
 is going on in that child's life? I have a 4 year old grandson about to
 begin pre-k, I have honestly considered homeschooling him due to the 
current policy and because I NEVER want my grandson to learn in school 
about transgender and non-binary and make a decision about his life 
without all of the information I believe he should have. I will love my 
grandson regardless of his chosen sexual orientation, I just don't think
 he is mature enough to make that decision in elementary school, 
especially without my guidance!! I deserve to know! I also deserve the 
right to decide when he will be introduced to the world of sensuality. 
When I was in school my mother had the right to choose whether I would 
be allowed to participate in the sequel education classes! I deserve 
that same right!!!!</p>

<div>
<p>As a teacher, we are asked to do so many things to protect students; 
from active shooter drills, to fire drills, to tornado drills, etc. The 
one SIMPLE thing that we could do to protect youth is to believe them 
when they tell us who they are. Youngkin's roll back is dangerous and 
unacceptable on so many levels. Schools&nbsp;should be welcoming and 
inclusive, not exclusionary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main concern should be on students learning, and what we can do 
to ensure that they are getting the best educaiton. If, as folx have 
been saying, we need to get students caught back up because of pandemic 
learning, then we need to focus on that. Students who feel threatened or
 not welcomed, will not come to school creating an even larger learning 
deficit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are&nbsp;literally talking about life and death for some of these 
students. Recent surveys show that transgender and non-binary students 
are far more likely to commit suicide&nbsp;than other students. Much of 
the most recent data on this is from the Trevor Project and CDC, linked 
below. A quick google search will let you know how important it is to 
protect these youth who identify as Trans and Non-Binary AS WELL AS all 
of the other LGBTQ+ youth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;We owe them support, love, and dignity...not.</p>

<p>This legislation is wildly contradictory.&nbsp; While in one section 
it states that it intended to protect each unique child, it also says 
that transgender people have no right to how they are treated.&nbsp; It 
states that no personal ideologies can be pressed upon another person, 
but then says that transgender people cannot express themselves fully 
because of other people's opinions on who they are.&nbsp; This policy 
would allow the opinions of individuals to dictate the lives of 
others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not freedom.&nbsp; I am a parent, I am Christian, and I 
believe that transgender people should be able to express themselves 
fully as they feel they are as an individual.&nbsp; I also believe that 
anyone looking to press their beliefs by not acknowledging the 
individual has violated their rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This legislation encourages the discrimination of transgender 
people.&nbsp; I believe that Virginia has an obligation to protect EVERY
 student.</p>

<p>The new 2022 guidance regarding transgender students assumes that in 
order to support parents' rights, they have to be informed of all 
decisions pertaining to their child. We don't do this with other things -
 we don't get parental consent before serving children lunch or 
assigning homework or going outside to play. This isn't really about 
parents' rights at all - it's about limiting the ability of transgender 
students to be themselves, particularly when parents and caregivers are 
not supportive of their students. If a parent/caregiver were abusing 
their child, we wouldn't ask for consent before having them talk to a 
school psychologist. We would act in the best interest of the child - we
 would PROTECT the child. Yes, I am comparing not supporting a 
transgender student to abuse. There are consequences when transgender 
students don't feel the support and acceptance for who they are. There 
is research on this which the VDOE has completely ignored in their 
willingness to pander to a handful of right-wing politicians and 
extremists who feel that it is their job to suppress the rights of 
others. We can support parents' rights AND protect vulnerable students 
from abusive and unsupportive parents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Protect trans youth and their families. This proposal by Youngkin is 
dangerous in its deliberate attempts to control the bodies of trans 
youth in public education. He has no place in making this decision that 
affect childrens’ lives and safety in being themselves. If you support 
this controlling move by Youngkin, you need to examine yourself and what
 you stand for.</p>

<p>Transgenderism is simply being pushed on children with undeveloped 
minds by mentally unstable pedophiles. This has no place in schools. It 
is child abuse by those who are supposed to teach these children.</p>

<p>Simply: this change of policy will endanger some of the most 
vulnerable children in our Commonwealth. Frankly, many children have to 
live a second life as their parents would harm them if knowing the truth
 about their sexuality or gender identity. The state has no right to be 
involved in mandating such a backwards policy -- this was settled years 
ago, leave it that way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy is harmful to trans teens because this opens up the 
possibility of family abuse and bullying from peers because they are not
 given any opportunity to explore their gender. This policy is obviously
 transphobic and wants to remove all acknowledgement of transgender 
people. As an adult who is transitioning after being married cis-male it
 must not be ignored for the mental safety of teens</p>

<p>Simply put, the decision on the extent and type of health care for a 
child is between the family and their medical advisors. The Gov't, and 
its representatives have no right or moral authority to insert their 
religious beliefs / morals into that private institution.</p>

<p>I fully support Gov. Youngkin making schools about teaching the basics again.</p>
<p>Activism has NO place around impressionable children who do not have 
the agency to make decisions for themselves. I can't believe anyone in a
 school setting would ever dare to keep a secret from a child's parents!</p>
<p>Parents make the decisions for THEIR kids until they are 18, end of story.</p>
<p>Schools have become overly concerned with "equity" and now our 
students are the last in the nation academically- Go back to teaching 
reading and math!</p>

<p>Thank you for careful attention given under the law, to retraction of
 the destructive policy and unlawful attack on parents, families and 
children in Virginia - and replacement with common sense and 
Constitutional order.</p>

<p>Not entirely sure what the issue is with letting kids be who they 
are. I will say forcibly outing a child can get them killed, stranded, 
and/or abused. I'd actually look at the prevailing medical and 
psychological opinions for guidance here. Key word being prevailing, NOT
 some lunatic with a degree but the majority of medical 
communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am writing against the proposal to require students to be referred 
to by their legal name and gender on their birth certificate. I do not 
understand why it is necessary to make a few people feel less 
uncomfortable at the cost of creating a life or death situation for a 
large number of LGBTQ students who are at risk of suicide if they must 
hide who they are. Please choose common sense and kindness. It does not 
cost us anything to let people be their authentic selves. Leave enough 
alone.</p>

<p>These policies strip away the rights of our most vulnerable students.
 School should be a place where all students feel seen, supported, and 
cared for. It is the responsibility of the state of Virginia to provide 
that environment for all students. The 2022 Model Policies do the 
opposite—creating a hostile environment that invalidates and erases 
trans students. The Board of Education should be using its resources to 
improve the lives of students, not harass and dehumanize the most 
vulnerable among them. As a public school teacher, I intend to use my 
students' preferred names and pronouns. My fellow teachers and I refuse 
to work for a public school system that prohibits us from treating all 
our students with the dignity and respect they deserve. If it comes down
 to it, we're prepared to find work outside of Virginia. The state 
already has a teacher shortage on its hands, and these policies are sure
 to drive away talented educators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transgender and gender non-conforming (GNC) youth face a 
disproportionately higher risk of negative physical and mental health 
impacts. These policies are in direct opposition to activist groups and 
educators who work daily to improve public education and address 
alarming gaps in inclusivity within our public institutions. As of 
9/6/2022, at least 28 transgender individuals in the United States were 
recorded as victims in violent homicide cases. This number steadily 
grows as a result of hate, lack of education, and that of policies that 
fail to protect transgender and GNC youth as they seek to grow within 
our public education system. These policies WILL result in a significant
 increase of both in-public, institutional, and at-home harm for 
students. Forcing teachers and students into a constant dance of 
regulations will remove the limited protections that were in place for 
students that come to public institutions (i.e. students who have a lack
 of resources or face domestic violence in their homes). Inclusivity 
should be at the forefront of this discussion, and our governor should 
prioritize ALL youth that he claims to protect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy will force trans kids who are in HRT and passing as 
another gender into a situation where it seems like a boy is using a 
girls bathroom or a girl is using a boys bathroom. If parents are 
learning their kid is trans because of a call from a school, there's a 
reason the child doesn't feel safe coming out to them and its an 
intrusion of the government (via schools) into private homes.</p>

<p>This is just yet another hate-fueled act of bigotry specifically 
designed to hurt a group already suffering higher rates of abuse, 
stigma, depression, and suicidal ideation at the hands of a few in power
 who desire to control everyone.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this policy. Not only will it endanger trans 
students, it violates VA state law. We know that trans kids are at a 
significantly higher risk for suicide and self harming behaviors. We 
need to support them and keep them safe, but this policy does the 
opposite. As a Virginia parent and teacher, I strongly oppose this 
policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transgender people deserve the respect and basic dignity of being 
allowed to live as their genders and use the facilities they need. 
Gender Dysphoria is a painful experience and is recognized as a 
legitimate medical issue by&nbsp; medical authorities. Attacking trans 
people is grounded solely in politics and not grounded at all in 
dignity, human rights, or science</p>

<p>If you were born with a penis, you are a male. If you were born with a
 vagina, you are a female. If after you are an adult, 18 years of age 
you decide you want to change your sex, then go for it. Children 
shouldn't even have these ideas in their heads. They should be worried 
about who's going to be at the monkey bars and who's it for hide and go 
seek. Stop cramming this idiocy down their throats and you'll be 
surprised how innocent and child like children can and will be. Whatever
 you were biologically born as is what restroom you visit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the love of this world, stop changing the true definition of what
 everything is to meet your beliefs. That's not how it works!&nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy is a downright embarrassment. Instead of focusing on 
things that are actually impacting large quantities of the population, 
you're focusing on a niche issue. Get out of people's crotches, and 
focus on things like teacher pay, funding schools properly, curbing 
youth gun violence, and improving the conditions for at-risk youth 
across the commonwealth.</p>

<p>These laws infringe on a child's right to privacy and subject them to
 cruel and unusual punishment for simply expressing who they are, and 
anyone who genuinely cares about chindren's well-being will not bring 
this law into fruition. It is part of a ghoulish coordinated attack 
against the trans community and I implore the lawmakers to side with 
reason and morals rather than hateful rhetoric.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees the rights of parents to direct 
the upbringing of their children. The U.S. Supreme Court has 
characterized a parent’s right to raise his or her child as “perhaps the
 oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.” 
Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000). Schools may not abrogate 
the rights of parents."</p>
<p>The 14th Amendment is referring to how a child is raised IN THEIR OWN
 HOME. This does not refer to how a public school must function. If 
parents want to dictate how their child thinks, behaves and is referred 
to then they must then invest in home schooling or any number of private
 schools that will indoctrinate these children to their way of thinking.</p>
<p>This new set of guidelines will allow parents to bring their beliefs 
into the classrooms and usurp the authority of the teachers and 
administration by breaking the trust bond between the students and 
staff. As teachers and parents, it is our duty to raise children to be 
independent. It is our duty to raise people who can think for themselves
 and act accordingly. This new set of guidelines is a misguided attempt 
at indoctrinating our children to conform rather than be independent 
thinkers. Shame on you!!!</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this proposed policy that tramples the rights and 
safety of trans and gender-conforming students. In its zeal to protect 
the rights of parents Virginia is overlooking that schools ought to be 
focused on making sure that STUDENTS flourish. Forbidding students to 
express themselves and explore their gender identities without written 
permission from their parents and requiring schools and teachers to tell
 parents information that students wish to keep private is needlessly 
cruel and excessive government interference and red tape. The rights of 
parents do not supersede the rights of students. We should respect that 
students know their own families and home situations better than state 
legislators do; if a student has not shared sensitive information with 
their parents they likely have a REASON for that and their concerns 
should be respected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy is going to get children hurt and killed if it goes into 
effect, both from self harm and psychological distress and from family 
abuse. Do not do this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am very concerned about the revisions to the Department of 
Education's Model Policy that revoke protections and support for 
transgender and gender non-conforming youth. These revisions create an 
environment of shame and hostility for gender diverse young people and 
compounds the risks they already face, including anxiety, depression, 
suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, and isolation from peers and 
supportive adults. To be clear, those risks are not inherent to diverse 
gender identity but are a result of society's discrimination toward 
gender diverse people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I urge Governor Youngkin and the Department of Education to repeal 
these revisions and instead institute a Model Policy that offers greater
 protections and support for all young people, including and especially 
those who are gender diverse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a parent of two public school children, and as a pastor, I am

among the most vulnerable of all children and youth. For many, school 
may be the safest place for them, just as it is for children who live in
 abusive homes. This proposed policy could put students in danger, and 
is clearly discriminatory against trans students. I strongly oppose 
this.</p>

<p>This policy is both unnecessary and cruel. I thought Republicans 
thought smaller government and local control was better?&nbsp; How about
 you let individual schools and districts decide what is best for the 
individuals they serve.&nbsp; Stop worrying about how people pee and 
more time solving real problems in this state.&nbsp; Let the kids figure
 it out.&nbsp; It isn't hurting anyone to let a trans child go by their 
preferred name and pronouns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm 54 years old, and grew up in Front Royal. I love the fields, 
rivers, the forests and mountains of my home. It broke my heart to love a
 place so much, and to be so unwelcome among the kids I grew up with, 
and victimized by parents and adults I’d never met. I was then, as now, 
transgender. I didn’t know other trans people existed until adulthood. 
Despite not having a name for it, or even understanding why, I was the 
target of slurs, bullying, and violence. Called a ‘<img src="VirginiaRegulatoryTownHallViewComments1_files/blackbox.gif" alt="black box" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: middle">,’
 ‘queerbait,’ ‘cocksucker,’ starting in first grade. Teachers laughed, 
said they were praying for me, that I had to toughen up. I was pulled 
out of classes with other kids in 5th grade because one of the teachers 
didn’t want “that little <img src="VirginiaRegulatoryTownHallViewComments1_files/blackbox.gif" alt="black box" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: middle">
 in my class.” They threatened to hold me back a year if I didn’t stop 
‘acting like a girl.’ But the thing is, I wasn’t acting. That was almost
 forty years ago. I left home, transitioned- which for me was the 
beginning of a long, successful, and extremely happy life. But the scars
 of my first 18 years on this Earth are deep, and it hurts so deeply to 
know that the place I grew up has not only not changed, but that the 
cruelty I endured has been polished and made official state 
policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why are you politicizing a completely normal decision made by 
teachers. Did you know that if a trans kid has a single supportive 
adult, their suicidality is cut in half. The reality is that Trans 
children need any available support and taking this away from them is 
akin to genocide. Speaking from experience, existing as a gender that 
you do not identify with is mental torture. Please do the right thing 
and reverse this decision.</p>

<p>The Northam 2021 Policy was not a measure to PROTECT trans students, 
but rather a political and cultural PUSH to force ALL students to 
question their sexual identity, to pit child against parent, and to take
 away the personal and religious freedoms of teachers who would not 
support this Big Lie.&nbsp; It is NOT the role of the school division or
 teachers to make transgenderism and sexual identity part of school 
curriculum.&nbsp; The Public School setting should NOT be a political 
playground where our children are used as lab experiments.&nbsp; I'm 
grateful that the new 2022 Policy will protect ALL children from the 
previous policy, and I'm hopeful that professional mental counseling 
will be encouraged for our kids who see themselves as anything other 
than beautifully-created in God's Image.</p>

<p>Many of our transgender youth do not have the support of their 
parents, and leaving this decision up to the parents could cause 
significant harm to our transgender students.&nbsp; Schools must remain a
 safe place for students, where they can be who they are without 
judgement or persecution.&nbsp; This is not a matter of religion, this 
is a matter of respect for a human.&nbsp; The policy needs to remain and
 not be changed.</p>

<p>I was proud to be a citizen of the Commonwealth of Virginia when we 
were a leader in protections for all of our school children. The current
 proposal most definitely does not support all children, in fact, it 
denigrates a vulnerable group. My child is nonbinary and though their 
journey to personal identity has been challenging, I cannot imagine how 
much more difficult it would have been without their 100% parental and 
school support through their adolescence. No child should have suicidal 
thoughts in our state because they fear acceptance from their community.
 This proposal makes the fear a reality and clearly states that anyone 
who is different is not accepted. Every person deserves the right to 
feel safe. Other people's comfort level is a non-issue in comparison to 
one person's actual physical safety. Trans kids are not rapists. Show me
 one evidence-based study that suggests that conclusion. Meanwhile, the 
research on the dangers trans kids face in an intolerant community are 
evident in the disproportionate numbers of suicide and self-harm that 
this group suffers. Educate yourself. This is not a political issue. It 
is a human rights issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A bill that prioritizes ignoring the thoughts, feelings and 
experiences of the very people it addresses has no place in a discussion
 of morality in government. Laws are meant to protect people, not to 
invalidate them or subject them to pain, suffering, displacement, 
discrimination, and in the worst cases, death. These children deserve to
 feel safe and loved unconditionally as they are. This bill plainly 
states that there is no such thing for them without permission from 
someone else. It is ignorant to suggest this policy, and sadistic to 
carry it out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As someone who just finished working on a school board campaign in 
Maryland, I spoke to a former school board member who was telling me 
about the LGBT liaison within the school system specifically citing the 
fact that the largest group of homeless youth are LGBT. Children come 
out at school and keep it from their parents because many aren’t 
accepting. We should not be putting pronouns and sexual orientation on 
the same level as in school fighting where parents need to be notified 
about it. This sends a wrong message and will encourage self-harm, 
suicide and that their identities are something to be ashamed of. This 
is completely regressive in nature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My kiddo was safe at their high school (graduated June '22), during a
 period of coming out as trans non binary, due to the ability &amp; 
willingness of the staff, teachers, advisors, &amp; counselors to call 
them by their correct pronouns. They are alive today because of this

<p>I am not a Republican.&nbsp; I am a lifelong Democrat.&nbsp; Based on
 that, I'm told that I'm supposed to find this new guidance 
hateful.&nbsp; However, I find myself strongly agreeing with this new 
guidance.&nbsp; My school district in Central Virginia currently has 
policies stating that my middle school age child can change her name, 
pronouns, and gender at school all without me as a parent being notified
 if my child asks for this information to be kept from me.&nbsp; 
Further, the policies in our school district state that they will give 
my child counseling to help her make these transitions, again without 
any notification to me as a parent if my child asks that I not be 
notified.&nbsp; That is an absolutely insane policy.&nbsp; At 12 years 
old, my child (and all children) lack the cognitive development to make 
these life changing decisions without my guidance.&nbsp; My 12 year old 
thinks bed time should be a choice, that dessert is acceptable for 
dinner, that she should be able to go where she wants when she wants, 
and many other simple things that I as a parent must help guide and 
direct.&nbsp; A life changing decision as important as altering gender 
is clearly something that as a parent, I need to be able to discuss with
 my child and provide guidance given the clearly not-fully-matured 
cognitive state present at this age.&nbsp; The proper upbringing of my 
child is my parental right.&nbsp; Schools do NOT have the right to keep 
important life decisions private from parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, with regard to bathroom and locker rooms, my district's 
policy currently states that students can use the facilities of 
preference and that alternative arrangements will be made for those who 
this makes uncomfortable.&nbsp; This policy makes it clear that 
"comfort" is the driving issue.&nbsp; But whose comfort should be 
respected?&nbsp; If a private changing room is adequate for students 
made uncomfortable by a biological male entering a girls locker room, or
 a biological female entering a male locker room, than why is it not 
adequate for that student who is uncomfortable using the locker room 
matching his or her own biological gender?&nbsp; Clearly, providing a 
private space to anyone uncomfortable with utilizing the facilities 
matching biological gender is a reasonable accommodation.&nbsp; If this 
reasonable accommodation is not enough, than the only logical conclusion
 if we follow the current path to the end is to allow all students to 
utilize whatever locker room they choose regardless of biological or 
stated gender, or to remove locker rooms entirely and have all students 
change clothes out in the open.&nbsp; Given that this topic is one of 
"comfort" and that somebody will be uncomfortable no matter what policy 
is put in place, the only logical path forward is to choose the policy 
that minimizes the number of uncomfortable individuals.&nbsp; That path 
is to maintain division of facilities based on biological gender.</p>

<p>Gender affirming care is PROVEN to save and improve lives! Refusing 
to provide or prohibiting gender affirming care is child abuse. No one 
is grooming kids to change genders. What would the point of that be? Who
 would benefit from that? Trust kids and look at the research that is 
readily available! 1 in 5 trans youth will attempt suicide before age 
30. Kids will literally die if this policy goes into effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trans kids deserve just as many rights as any other student!

<p>The Youngkin govt (and many people responding to this forum) don't 
understand the issues around trans youth and will cause extreme harM to a
 vulnerable population&nbsp;because of outdated, misguided policies. 
This is personal for me. I’ve known several people who had never felt 
comfortable in their assigned gender and came very close to taking their
 own lives after living years with depression and despondence. 
After&nbsp;“coming out” as the gender they always experienced, their 
outlook improved greatly. The only danger to their well-being comes from
 people who want to attack them -- politically, ideologically and/or 
physically. The movement to express one’s true gender, to use their 
preferred pronouns and to live the lives they choose is growing and 
society needs to adjust outdated beliefs, not impose dangerous laws that
 harm. Stop attacking trans people.</p>

<p>I oppose this policy by Governor Youngkin. IT can be very dangerous 
to out a transgender student without their consent or prior knowledge, 
as the rate of homeless trans people compared to the size of their 
overall community - along with those who get discriminated against in 
the workforce and in healthcare is already much higher than the general 
population. Please keep students - including transgender ones - 
safe!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>As&nbsp; a parent I strongly oppose these rules.</strong></p>
<p>My heart breaks reading the fear and anguish from LGBTQ youth that 
now feel unsafe and threatened by this administration cruel and 
vindictive "rules": <a rel="nofollow" x="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/09/23/virginia-transgender-youngkin-students-outing/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/09/23/virginia-transgender-youngkin-students-outing/</a></p>
<p>We should all protect kids and give them all the tools to find and 
protect who they are. As a parent I know this is not about parents 
right. In fact it's the complete opposite where it takes away my ability
 to protect my child and have them learn in a just and tolerant society.
 This forces extremist conservative views into school administration and
 makes it harder for all parents to provide a safe and supportive 
education. These documents teaches our children that intolerance and 
that bullying and shaming others for self promotion is acceptable. This 
is not the type of society I want to live in.</p>
<p>Rarely have so few (4000 out of 1.2M) been targeted and threatened by
 the government that should be protecting and helping our most 
vulnerable kids thrive. Gov. Youngkin is using kids as political pawns 
to wage a shameful culture war and raise money from conservatives 
extremists that have forgotten their religion used to be about 
protecting the vulnerable and disenfranchised.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The guidance “Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender 
Students in Virginia’s Public Schools” sets a terrible precedent for 
schools to act in loco parentis, which is outside the constitutional 
precedent. Should schools have the responsibility of telling parents 
about their kids’ political or social leanings, about crushes and 
friends? This is a very slippery slope. Let schools do what they do 
best: teach. And encourage parents to listen to and establish a loving 
and trusting relationship with their kids at home.</p>

          <strong>As a parent and aunt: Strongly Oppose Rolling Back Protections for Students</strong>

<p>As a parent and aunt to several students who would be impacted by 
this or similar decisions, I strongly oppose the roll back of existing 
protections for all students, especially LGBTQIA+ students. It is the 
government's job to protect all, and that includes those who could be 
put in extreme danger from disclosure of their personal identities. The 
government should not be in the business of policing bodies, choices, or
 rights of any one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If my daughter decided to identify as something other than a cis 
female, that is her choice and right to do so, regardless of how I feel 
(although of course, I would support and love her no matter what). Her 
choice would not put any other students or herself in harms way, and as 
long as that remains the case, I am happy to let her be her authentic 
self, no matter what that looks like.</p>
<p>Public schools should be apolitical, areligious, and inclusive. As 
someone who identifies as agnostic at best, my child should not be 
exposed to religious doctrine, phraseology, or teachings without my 
consent. By taking a stance on gender identity, I firmly believe the 
government is making a religious statement. Public schools should be for
 the protection and betterment of those in its care.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this discriminatory guidance and policy by the

bigots. That is unconscionable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For emphasis:</p>
<p>THIS POLICY WAS EXPLICITLY DESIGNED TO HARM CHILDREN. IT SHOULD NOT BE ADOPTED.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It really is that simple.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those responsible for creating this policy proposal should be deeply 
ashamed, and furthermore disallowed from participating in the education 
system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again:</p>
<p>THIS POLICY WAS EXPLICITLY DESIGNED TO HARM CHILDREN. IT SHOULD NOT BE ADOPTED.</p>
<p>Full stop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trans and non-binary students are among the most vulnerable groups in
 schools. These students are the ones likely to experience violence and 
discrimination, not the other way around. I think Governor Youngkin's 
new policy is cruel, full stop. There is nothing students, teachers, or 
parents will gain by discriminating against trans and non-binary 
students.</p>
<p>I strongly oppose school boards taking up this policy.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this guidance. This is illegal discrimination at 
both the state and federal level and is categorically and intentionally 
harmful to the trans community. Instituting cruel policies like this to 
score political points and stoke division is disgusting behavior every 
American should reject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy will kill trans kids. It will cause despair and fear and 
depression. These policies are actively violent towards vulnerable 
children, and anyone who supports this policy will have blood on their 
hands.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with safety and everything to do with 
extremist fascist policies a minority of people in this country are 
pursuing. Please reject this guidance and protect children.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>"The Code of Virginia reaffirms the rights of parents to determine how their children will be raised and educated"</em></p>
<p>I don't want my kids educated within an ignorant and prejudiced 
system that does not respect and celebrate diversity.&nbsp; Where are my
 parental rights when my tax dollars are being spent on policies that 
are not conducive to the learning environment I want for my 
children?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I oppose the governors new trans policy. I’m afraid this will lead to
 sucide among the trans youth. Just because you don’t understand doesn’t
 give you the right to take away their rights. If your truly about 
educating and protecting ALL youth this is definitely not how you do it.</p>

<p>Every peer-reviewed and reputable piece of research shows supporting,
 protecting, and respecting trans children greatly reduces rates of 
depression, self-harm, and suicide. This legislation IGNORES all of 
that.</p>
<p>KEEP SCHOOLS SAFE FOR ALL CHILDREN.</p>

          <strong>Virginia Must Increase Protective Factors for Students</strong>

<p style="line-height: 107%; margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Tw Cen MT', sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The
 Virginia Rural Health Association is troubled by the new guidelines 
announced by Governor Younkin that address parental rights for 
transgender students.&nbsp; VRHA remains committed to the health and 
wellbeing of all rural Virginians, inclusive of mental health.&nbsp; 
VRHA launched our Pride of Rural Virginia initiative last year and is 
aware that support and resources for LGBTQIA+ youth is harder to access 
in our rural communities.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 107%; margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Tw Cen MT', sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 107%; margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Tw Cen MT', sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The
 new guidelines state parents must be informed and given the opportunity
 to object before the school provides counseling services related to 
gender.&nbsp; The implementation of this restriction will mean that 
parents who are unsupportive of their transgender child can refuse 
counseling services for the student.&nbsp; Additionally, notifying the 
parents may increase the potential of a student being verbally or 
emotionally abused by a non-supportive parent.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 107%; margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Tw Cen MT', sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 107%; margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Tw Cen MT', sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The
 University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center recently released 
the policy brief “Key Informant Perspectives on Supporting Health and 
Well-Being for LGBTQ+ Rural Residents.”&nbsp; That document outlines a 
number of barriers to health equity for our LGBTQIA+ citizens with lack 
of services and an unsupportive environment listed first.&nbsp;

 LGBTQ youth lack access to affirming spaces, with only 55% of LGBTQ

<p>I was a public school teacher for 34 years. I had hoped to make it to
 40 but the stress of a political response to public health policy and 
the anxiety over policies enacted in my state with regard to “CRT”, 
transgender students being banned from sports and the restrictions on 
literature that disproportionately excludes the voices of Black authors,
 LGBTQ authors who are only quite recently even being published, the 
angry parents voices who scream that teachers are “groomers” - it all 
became far too much for me to endure in an increasingly thankless 
profession. Some of you may be delighted that you have driven me away, 
despite my having successfully taught the highest levels of mathematics,
 while earning advanced degrees (the only way we have to increase our 
salaries) and sending thousands of students on to the best universities 
with a foundation for success.</p>
<p>I was openly gay throughout my career. I didn’t speak of it in the 
classroom but I stifled all racism, homophobia, or sexism as it 
occurred. My classroom was always a safe space. I also sponsored a Pride
 organization for LGBTQ+ students and I have come to know and advocate 
for hundreds of these students. We engendered a culture in my school 
that intentionally and proactively included LGBTQ students. This is not 
to say that we solved anything - there were still incidences of bullying
 and hatred, particularly to the most intersectional of our students. 
But, we had an administration with a consciousness around these issues 
and they were addressed. It wasn’t Utopia but every inch of progress is 
so deeply felt and appreciated by the students who are marginalized.</p>
<p>What I cannot understand is what real threat you believe we present 
to your children. My Pride Coalition only asked to be accepted and 
respected. We weren’t handing toasters out in the cafeteria, trying to 
recruit people to become LGBTQ. We only wanted allies, to be heard, to 
see ourselves represented. Why is it so hard for you to just leave us 
alone?</p>

<p dir="ltr">We are the healthcare professionals who take care of 
Virginia’s children and families, dedicating our lives to serving you 
and your children in your greatest moments of need. Rooted in our tenets
 of healing, beneficence, and self-determination, we are called to 
advocate for the transgender and gender-diverse youth for whom we care, 
who will be irreparably harmed if the proposed 2022 Model Policies on 
Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia’s
 Public Schools comes into fruition.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Affirming a child’s gender identity, whether at home, at 
the doctor’s, or in school, is crucial to the child’s health and 
wellbeing. We know the statistics, that in 2021, over half of all 
transgender and gender-diverse youth considered killing themselves, and 
one in five attempted suicide.&nbsp; But for us, these statistics are 
more than numbers; they are the names and faces and memories of children
 we’ve met and cared for. In their moments of hopelessness, we find hope
 together knowing that when a child’s identity and pronouns are honored,
 their suicidality lessens.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the aforementioned proposed school policy 
enacts dangerous barriers to the safety of transgender and 
gender-diverse children. First, in mandating schools to inform 
unsupportive parents of their child’s identity, this policy obliterates 
the one affirming space a child may have and increases the risk of 
suicide and abuse by unnecessarily provoking parental hostility and 
rejection. Additionally, it bans any measure to affirm a child’s 
identity without written parental instruction by requiring school 
employees to use the student’s legal sex and name instead of affirming 
their pronouns and name. This extraordinarily harmful mandate has no 
legal basis. The referenced US Supreme Court cases of Troxel v 
Granville, Wisconsin v Yoder, and Pierce v Society of Sisters refer to 
matters of familial visitation and the right to withdraw from public 
school - not a parent’s right to deny their child’s identity and access 
to critical health services, such as gender counseling.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, the proposed policy mandates students to 
participate in extracurricular activities and use bathrooms according to
 their assigned sex, despite legal precedent considering this unlawful 
discrimination.&nbsp; In fact, this proposed policy eliminates every 
effort in its predecessor to create a nurturing and supportive 
environment, apathetic to the psychological and physical consequences to
 our transgender and gender-diverse youth. This policy claims that, “All
 students have the right to attend school in an environment free from 
discrimination, harassment, or bullying,” yet persecutes children by 
denying them their identity. Any policy that directs teachers and staff 
to mistreat their students in this way is discriminatory at best and 
deadly at worst.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">As Virginia’s healthcare workers, we are the ones who see 
children in emergency departments when they decide their lives aren’t 
worth living anymore, when the trauma in their bodies manifest as 
seizures or psychosis or debilitating pain. We are the ones who listen 
to these children weep as we try to convince them that their future is 
bright and real, that the bullying will one day be in the past, that 
acceptance of who they are will come. When we say that this proposed 
policy will devastate our children’s safety, we know from witnessing it 
ourselves. This policy will negatively impact the health and wellbeing 
of our children, leading to higher rates of suicide and self-harm, and 
we demand this proposal be denied.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transgender Identity has no place in our schools. This is between 
parent and child. With the sexual grooming, pornography, CRT, Equity 
issues in our daily classes it is no wonder our children can’t read. 
Leave our children out of this and turn these issues to the parents. 
Teach our children cursive writing, math, science, English, history. 
They don’t do homework any longer, books and we don’t see what they are 
doing. Secrets, secrets and more secrets. Give us transparency about 
their daily lessons. INVOLVE the parents! Leave our children alone and 
let them be children. Va Beach School Board has now decided that we are 
sharing our parental right with them!&nbsp;</p>

<p>This bill is beyond the pale. Absolute rubbish. Trans kids have just

that, who are you to force exposure on some of the most marginalized

<p>If Republicans were actually pro life, they would be against this 
policy, too. The amount of children who commit suicide due to bullying 
for being different than their peers is truly devastating. Virginia 
schools should embrace our differences and be inclusive to all.

<p>It is well documented that LGBTQ+ youth are significantly more likely
 to attempt suicide when they are in unsupportive environments. The 
policies proposed create an environment which is actively hostile to 
Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming youth, and will result in a higher
 occurrence of self harm. The current policies supporting and protecting
 trans youth are the policies which need to be kept in place. That is 
how you protect kids.</p>

<p>Transgender students are a vulnerable group and should be protected! 
They are already often subject to bullying and sometimes have to hide 
their true selves for fear of backlash from their community. Schools 
should be a safe space where they can be seen for who they truly are and
 where they are free to express themselves safely!</p>

<p>I oppose any law or policy that does not protect lgbtq+ children. 
They must have a right to feel some sort of safety at school, especially
 when y’all don’t care about their physical safety. Do something 
actually helpful like gun safety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy seems unaware that the appropriate role of schools in our
 society is to provide education in a safe place. This idea of a "safe 
place" has been mocked by unkind people who deliberately misinterpret 
it, but school is often the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span>
 place vulnerable children are safe. It is critically important that 
schools serve as advocates for children of all kinds, and that they 
provide access to the support and services children need, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">whether or not their parents approve</span><em>.</em></p>
<p>If a student, for example, wants to remove a yarmulke or a hijab 
while in class, it is that student's right to do so, and the school has 
no responsibility to inform the parents of that behavior. In the same 
way, if a student chooses to dress or be addressed in a way that 
conforms to their identity, they have the right to do that, and the 
school has no obligation — nor really, even, any <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right</span> — to inform that child's parents. </p>
<p>This policy will expose children to abuse at school and at home. This
 government action doesn't protect the citizens of Virginia, and it 
doesn't represent me.</p>

<p><strong>There is no evidence that allowing transgender students to 
choose bathroom or locker room facilities that correspond to their 
gender identity puts other students at risk</strong>. Barring 
transgender students from facilities that are safe, comfortable, and 
gender affirming is discriminatory, and that discrimination causes real 
harm - including increased rates of depression, anxiety, and 
suicidality. <strong>This policy places transgender students at 
heightened risk of harassment, assault, and bullying, impedes their 
ability to secure an education and participate fully in the life of 
their schools, and can cause damage to their physical and emotional 
health.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Virginia can and should do a better job of protecting vulnerable 
trans students and teaching all students the power of kindness.&nbsp; <strong>A
 school community that is safe and kind and welcoming to ALL students 
will be better able to nurture those characteristics in all students</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This change in policy is based on ignorance and comes across 
as mean-spirited and cruel. Virginia's leadership should do the 
research, listen to experts, and lead with integrity to unify our 
communities and schools rather than dividing us through harmful policies
 like this one.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This policy takes AWAY rights from parents. It requires teachers to 
police parents and question the way they raise their children - making 
Virginia a less safe place to raise children. This policy hurts ALL kids
 no matter their identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The very first question must be, "How do we keep children safe?"<br><br>This
 fails as an answer. We know, as an overwhelming matter of fact, that 
the difference in suicide rate for trans youth is whether or not their 
gender identity is supported or suppressed.&nbsp;<br><br>Whatever else 
can be said, we cannot in good conscience choose policies that result in
 child suicide rates increasing. There is no moral way to do so. 
None.&nbsp;<br><br>All of the other debate may still be on the table, but the fundamental, basic question has to be this:<br><br>Are you OK with children killing themselves?&nbsp;<br><br>The
 answer has to be "No" and every policy decision thereafter has to be 
born of that answer. Not every decision will be cut-and-dried, and not 
every decision will be to everyone's liking-- sometimes, we will 
assuredly face situations where two groups have opposing interests and 
that can be OK, too.<br><br>But no one should die over it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This cruel policy is nothing more than political theatre. Our

It would be helpful if he did something other than push culture war

 wolf in a fleece sweater vest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Creating a policy that is both harmful to kids and most likely 
illegal both with regard to Grimm v. Gloucester, &amp; VA Code § 
22.1-23.3 is unnecessarily cruel and will be a waste of state time and 
resources <strong>(</strong><strong>AKA OUR TAX DOLLARS)</strong> when it faces the inevitable legal challenges and is the opposite of fiscal responsibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does does nothing to help the state and focusing on petty culture 
war issues is pathetic when there are real problems facing our schools 
like lack of teacher pay and outdated buildings. Just resign if y'all 
have no intentions of actually helping the state and its citizens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The proposed policy simply ensures that parents’ constitutional 
rights are fully protected. The previous policy allowed schools to keep 
secrets from parents, which is outrageous. Parents do not lose their 
parental rights when they send their children to school. It’s astounding
 to me that educators believe that they know better than parents and 
that their rights should usurp parental rights. Did the people opposing 
this policy even read it???</p>

<p>The proposed rulings on barring trans youth from using the bathroom 
of their self-identified gender, and requiring teachers to use a name 
they do not identity with, is done without any merit as to the 
well-being of the children, students, parents, or teachers. Studies show
 using the trans youth’s preferred name and pronouns drastically reduces
 the youth’s chance of suicide and dramatically improves their mental 
health - and with that, their school performance. To bar this from 
happening is cruel and vindictive, evil in my opinion. Do not implement 
this law!</p>

<p>It is clear that the Governor and his party are determined to use our
 public schools as pawns in the culture war they continue to orchestrate
 in service of their political and economic goals. This "guidance" is 
nothing more than ammunition for this war. It has no value in improving 
our schools or the welfare and education of our children. The Guidance 
should not be adopted, and it should be filed in the trashcan.</p>
<p>If the Governor had interest in improving public education and our 
state’s economic and cultural inclusiveness, he would invest more in 
teacher compensation, school facilities, and social services, each of 
which would provide every child in Virginia with a better chance to 
excel for themselves and create long-term, sustainable prosperity for 
their families and communities. But that obviously isn’t the Governor’s 
interest at all. Rather, the clear, transparent goal is to eviscerate 
the public school system by reducing investment in it, and turning 
public opinion against educators and school administrators.</p>
<p>The public school system is intended to embrace diversity of 
thinking, intellectual inquiry and discovery, and connection between 
peoples of different cultures and values. These are essential to the 
health and prosperity of our state and its people. But the Guidance 
achieves none of these goals: it limits thinking to prevailing norms 
that do not accommodate difference; it prohibits intellectual inquiry 
and discovery by demanding homogeneity and conformance; and it destroys 
any hope of social connection by fomenting anger and division between 
people of different cultures and values.</p>
<p>It is terrible guidance, cynical politics, and clearly constructed in
 bad faith. It should be acknowledged for what it is: a side-show 
theater in service of specific political and economic goals. And those 
responsible for it should be ashamed of themselves and apologize to all 
Virginians for wasting time, money, and attention while ignoring the 
more pressing challenges and opportunities that Virginia faces today.</p>

<p>I am opposed to this guidance. The guidance doesn't properly 
acknowledge and account for the potential harm that may be inflicted on 
trans students through use of pronouns or a name that they no longer 
identify with. With regards to the rights of the personnel; it is not 
and should not be protected for someone to call someone a name or 
pronouns that they don't identify with. Not all beliefs are 
constitutionally protected especially when they clash with the rights of
 others or involve discrimination based on a protected class. It is not 
permissible for someone with a belief that is against the law to assert 
that the belief protects them from the law and there already exist 
situations where school division personnel can express inappropriate 
beliefs or comments which cause them to lose their job even if not 
against the law. The proposed guidance seems to suggest that the 
previous model policies oppose parental involvement when they in fact 
encouraged it. The support of parents is an incredibly important 
component to ensuring that children remain safe and protected from 
harassment in schools (especially trans children). The policies just 
recognize that the parent isn't the only method of supporting children 
in school and that the school itself plays a large part.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For many students school is a place of learning and acceptance, it is
 a place to explore new ideas and to find community. This new policy 
targets an already marginalized community, and worse it will make trans 
students feel as if they do not exist. As a cis woman, I have had the 
honor of loving someone who is trans and playing alongside trans 
athletes as a collegiate athlete on a women's team. I have witnessed the
 cruel and unfair treatment that they have received in both an 
educational and collegiate athletic setting. I hope that trans youth do 
not have to face these same challenges, and policies such as this one 
are simply heartbreaking. I ask that you speak to trans youth and to the
 families of trans youth who simply want their children to be able to 
succeed in school. Trans youth are just like any other students, they 
simply want to be seen and respected. Finally, imagine if you replaced 
the word transgender with any other marginalized group, it would be 
considered outright discrimination. So why is this discrimination 
suddenly okay when it involves trans youth?</p>

rights of trans youth.&nbsp;</span></p>

 &nbsp;My son is in a committed relationship with a young trans man. We 
adore him. He is one of the wisest people I know. He is dedicating his 
life to helping other trans young people to be included in our civil 
society,&nbsp;by becoming a counselor for trans people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #500050;">&nbsp;
 &nbsp;Through him, I have learned that being trans is NOT a choice, it 
is who they are. I have also learned that many families have family 
members that are trans. This number is growing, as we begin as a society
 to learn that trans people ARE, SHOULD BE and we NEED THEM TO BE part 
of our society. We can learn a lot from the trans community about 
acceptance, facing uphill battles and conquering their fears and about 
loving someone for who they are.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #500050;">&nbsp;
 Sadly, many trans youths are not supported in schools and at home. Many
 suffer debilitating depression as a result. And statistics show 
that&nbsp;fewer than 1 in 3 trans and nonbinary youth felt affirmed in 
their gender at home, and LGBTQ youth who felt high social support from 
their family reported attempting suicide at less than half the rate of 
those who felt low or moderate social support. The survey found that 
LGBTQ youth who reported their school to be LGBTQ-affirming also 
reported lower rates of attempting suicide. Even more alarming is the 
fact that&nbsp;59% of transgender boys and men reported seriously 
considering suicide in the past year, as did 53% of nonbinary youth and 
48% of transgender girls and women. 22% of transgender boys and men 
reported attempting suicide in the past year, compared to 6% of 
cisgender boys and men.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; background: white; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; color: #500050;">&nbsp; We should be better than this as a society and certainly as Virginians.&nbsp;</span></p>

 ask that the citizens of Virginia step up and fight for the rights of 
all people and in this case, for members of the trans community. 
Certainly the governor of our state should be protecting the rights of 
our trans youth and adults. Let Gov. Youngkin know that Virginia is 
better than this new policy to discriminate against trans youth.</span></p>

<p>This is not about hate. It's about protecting all children and not 
only thinking of a few. Most people opposing this probably heard about 
this on the news and aren't even from VA. As long as your own children 
aren't affected, you probably don't care right?&nbsp;</p>

<p>This guidance represents a callous disregard for the safety and 
well-being of vulnerable students. Members of the lgbtq+ community are 
greater targets for bullying, harassment, shaming and as a result, face 
higher risks of self harm and suicide. For those who feel excluded, 
different, and alone in their schools or in their own homes, you should 
be REINFORCING NOT REMOVING THEIR SUPPORT SYSTEMS. You should be doing 
everything within your power to protect their lives.</p>

<p>This proposed policy is a dangerous, ill informed, and discriminatory. </p>
<p>The previous model policy for the treatment of transgender students 
included input from a wide variety of stakeholders, including educators,
 students, professionals, and parents. It was written with the best 
interest of transgender students in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why propose a policy that isn’t informed by or supportive of the population it will impact?</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this This guidance is a thinly veiled effort to 
hurt and humiliate transgender students, and I am ashamed at the 
backwards movement of my beloved commonwealth.</p>
<p>First - requiring teachers to get parental permission to use 
nicknames is ludicrous.&nbsp; Many VA teachers have 150+ students.&nbsp;
 Many of these students have parents who speak little to no 
English.&nbsp; It is an unnecessary burden to force teachers to call the
 parent of every child who doesn't want to be called the name on their 
birth certificate.&nbsp; This will also hurt the teacher's relationship 
with their student, especially when peers are using a nickname that a 
teacher cannot use according to state guidance.&nbsp; Put simply, you 
are creating a burden for teachers and damaging the classroom 
environment in your zeal to hurt transgender children.</p>
<p>Second - being transgender is not inherently wrong.&nbsp; While I 
agree that schools should keep parents informed when a child engages in 
wrong behavior (bullying, cheating, stealing, etc.) it is ridiculous to 
demand teachers inform parents of not-wrong behavior (diet, religion, 
grammar, dress, etc.).&nbsp; If a child declares they are atheist in 
class, does that require a call home?&nbsp; If a child does not wear a 
hijab to class who usually does, does that require a call home?&nbsp; If
 a child eats a Twinkie, does that require a call home?&nbsp; Unless the
 Commonwealth is prepared to argue that gender identity is more 
important that religion, you are placing another unnecessary burden on 
teachers to interfere in a child's family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, leave my family out of your culture war and let teachers do
 their jobs and TEACH. If a child wants to be called a certain name, 
treat them with respect, use the name they prefer, and get back to the 
lesson.&nbsp; When they need to go to the bathroom, let them go to the 
bathroom.&nbsp; I can't believe I have to write this.&nbsp; This is 
2022.&nbsp; Please don't pull us backwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new guidelines on the treatment of transgender and nonbinary 
students in schools are misguided and harmful. Many LGBTQ+ kids are not 
safe in their homes and are especially susceptible to bullying at 
school. Why would you put teachers in a position where they have more 
latitude to contribute to the bullying than to protect their students? I
 find it impossible to believe that those who crafted these cruel and 
harmful policies have ever spoken to a transgender or nonbinary child 
(or adult for that matter) - they are human beings who are infinitely 
more likely to be the victim of violence or bullying than the 
perpetrator. They are not political pawns - they are children who need 
to be supported as they go through the incredibly important period of 
figuring out who they are.&nbsp;</p>

degenerative left wing politics. Kudos to Governor Youngkin for

<p>I completely disagree with Governor Youngkin’s new policy on 
transgender students. It is very wrong to force those students to use 
bathrooms that don’t align with the gender they identify with. Let 
students use what pronouns they prefer, as well as which bathroom they 
prefer!</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this guidance. This is illegal discrimination at 
both the state and federal level and is categorically and intentionally 
harmful to the trans community. Instituting cruel policies like this to 
score political points and stoke division is disgusting behavior every 
American should reject.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy will kill trans kids. It will cause despair and fear and 
depression. These policies are actively violent towards vulnerable 
children who deserve our protection and support. Countless studies done 
by the ACA, APA, and AMA have proven that transgender kids are 1) real 
and 2) are at a greater risk for suicide <em><strong>because of these types of policies and politicians who refuse to support them and back well documented research.&nbsp;</strong></em>Kids
 are not being groomed - they are finally being allowed to express 
themselves wholly as they are and if we allow our kids to express 
themselves that will lead to a happier, more productive society. Isn’t 
that what any politician wants?</p>
<p>Please follow the research and the medical guidance created by 
thousands of well-trained scientists, therapists, and medical doctors 
and SUPPORT TRANS YOUTH.</p>

<p>The proposed policies claim to foster privacy, dignity, and respect. 
They instead require changes that undermine privacy, dignity, and 
respect for students and their parents.</p>
<p>The proposed policies received no public input while being drafted, 
were not developed in accordance with evidence-based best practices, are
 directly contrary to the law they purport to implement, and will put 
transgender and non-binary students at risk for harm and discrimination 
at school.</p>
<p>The proposed policies violate the Virginia Human Rights Act.</p>
<p>The proposed policies do not respect the parental rights of those 
parents who want their transgender, nonbinary, and gender-expansive 
children to live their lives safely as themselves. &nbsp;Similarly, they
 do not respect the rights of patents and students who want to make sure
 VA schools provide a positive and welcoming learning environment for

<p>As Governor, Youngkin’s &nbsp;job is to protect ALL 
&nbsp;constituents regardless of their beliefs. This policy endangers 
our youth by not offering protection for those that have a different 
opinion.</p>
<p>I oppose this new model policy.</p>

<p>Youngkin’s policies are disgustingly out of touch. Children are human
 beings, not property that parents are free to use or command any way 
they desire. We already acknowledge that these limits exist, which is 
why the state removes children from unsafe environments.</p>
<p>Every human has a right to their own identity. If parents are 
concerned that their children are hiding something from them, they 
should look at their own parenting to answer why they don’t have an open
 and loving relationship. Students have a right to seek help for 
questions and issues they encounter in their own lives. Exploring their 
identity does not harm them, so there is no responsibility for a school 
to disclose a student’s personal business.</p>
<p>Youngkin is not trying to help Virginians. His transparent attempts 
to jockey for national attention are disgusting and will harm real 
children.</p>

<p>This policy will kill children. Kids deserve to feel safe in their 
own identities and to have the same freedom of speech the rest of us do.
 Do not silence them or force them into hiding. You will never get rid 
of trans kids or trans people and we will never stop fighting these 
policies. Freedom and safety for all our children!!!</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">Good morning. I am especially qualified to
 speak on this topic, as I am a middle school counselor and I have a 
trans teen. The GOP needs to stop cruel &nbsp;political theater to 
pander when it will absolutely hurt the kids it is “protecting”. 
&nbsp;Not all kids are safe coming out at home &nbsp;but want &nbsp;peer
 support at school. Schools should be a safe space no matter what. 
&nbsp;This is a small percentage of kids we’re targeting, can we focus 
on more pressing and relevant issues???</p>

<p>As the parent of a 12 y.o. trans son, I don't get the hate. Before 
socially transitioning about two years ago, my kid was withdrawn, angry,
 and experienced suicidal ideation. Now he's outgoing, "quirky" (as he 
calls it), and happier than he's ever been. He blows everyone away with 
his artistic talent and last year wrapped up the 5th grade with honors. 
All this because he's allowed to live as himself both at home AND at 
school.</p>
<p>I'm fortunate enough as a parent to not worry about his school being 
unsupportive or hostile. They won't deadname or misgender him, and 
almost nobody outside of the school administration even knows he's 
trans. I haven't received a call from a concerned principal about my 
child being "one of those transes".</p>
<p>Not every trans kid is fortunate enough to have a supportive home. 
That's why forced outing will put kids in literal danger. Others will be
 forced back into the closet. If I were more pessimistic, I'd almost say
 that was the point.</p>
<p>So let me set the record straight for anyone who thinks trans kids 
are some kind of anomaly to be suppressed. My son, and other trans kids 
like him, are not a wedge issue to score points with a rabid base before
 the midterms. They are human beings, not political props.</p>
<p>DO. BETTER.</p>

<p>The fact that the document's title contains the phrase "...PRIVACY, 
DIGNITY, AND RESPECT FOR ALL STUDENTS..." is ridiculous. It's clearly 
casting aside a majority of compassionate folks and elevating an opinion
 of a small minority of conservatives who judge others based on sex and 
gender. This is not in line with what a majority of students and parents
 want. These policies are playing to the lowest denominator and denies 
the right of people to live their authentic self so that they can be 
happy and actually have the headspace to learn. I find these policies to
 be discriminatory and they should be reviewed to determine whether they
 are even legal.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the 2022 guidance. It assumes and ideal world where
 all parents are supportive of children and always provide the best 
possible situation for a child to be in. The stories from trans children
 clearly indicate we do not live in this ideal world. This guidance will
 cost lives and seems to be a thinly veiled way of allowing religious 
beliefs to be a ticket to behave cruelly. We are talking about children 
who should be treated as human beings with compassion and respect, not 
pawns in a religious liberty fight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Governor claims to recognize that each child is unique and that 
Virginia must encourage and respect the individual needs of all 
students.&nbsp; Yet, his proposed policy does just the opposite.&nbsp; 
Implementation of this policy certainly does not take into account each 
child's specific situation and will only result in "outing" already 
vulnerable children merely to pander to a very loud minority of 
transphobic adults.&nbsp; I strongly oppose implementation of this 
policy.</p>

<p>are there not higher priorities when it comes to “protecting

          <strong>Some parents will never allow their child's transition</strong>

<p>The simple fact is some parents hate that their children are 
transgender, and they will never accept recognition of who their child 
really is. Their children are still trans regardless. Forcing the school
 system to hold up such a parent's delusion about who their child is 
helps nobody.</p>
<p>A child only has so many communities. Family, school, perhaps a 
church/hobby/friend group outside the house if they are lucky. This 
change in policy means that when a family is not accepting, for the vast
 majority of their waking hours this person will be forced to live a 
lie. For <em>years</em>. And that's <em>after</em> they've got up the courage to tell someone, a trusted someone, that something feels <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm lucky enough to have an immediate family that 
supports my transition (been a few years, I'm 27 now). But others don't 
have that. And the parent able to say no to everything will, 
unsurprisingly, say no to everything. Every clause in this policy that 
defers to parents will -- in the case of bad parents who would rather 
pretend to raise a different, imaginary child than the one actually in 
front of them -- result in the school helping to shove a student right 
back in the closet. This isn't going to go down well.</p>
<p>My Radical Leftist Woke Take™ is that parents should not own their 
children. One's life is one's own. For without that, what else could 
possibly be theirs?</p>

<p>This document proposes taking away children's ability to express 
themselves as individuals in the public school setting. It's deeply 
dangerous, especially for any children who may be exploring their gender
 identity while living in an unsupportive household. Republicans, please
 live up to the "small government" motto you love to say that you agree 
with, and leave the government out of people's gender and sexual 
identities. This document is absolute garbage, and I strongly 
oppose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Children are not political pawns that you get to villiafy one day and

 families that could be addressed but instead you focus on the election

<p>I oppose the proposed policy changes by the youngkin administration. 
As a mother of 4 children in the Virginia public school system, I want 
to make sure that all children that are questioning their identity or 
are transgender are protected even if it means that their privacy is 
protected above my knowledge and access to every discussion or request. 
&nbsp;This puts kids at risk and I don’t understand how anyone who wants
 to protect children would consider removing or changing these policies.</p>

<p>At best, this is misguided from a lack of understanding and 
information, and at worst this a malicious attack on people due to 
bigotry. At no point does it make sense to remove the rights of citizens
 who've nothing but exist.</p>

<p>This policy is harmful and so backwards. Why in the world would we 
make the LGBTQ+ community a target? Youngkin has been a nightmare to any
 progress in this state. To the parents of LGBTQ children, I am so sorry
 that you are living this hell because of politics and fear and 
uneducation.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Parental Notification/Trans Student Policy </strong>
        </div>

<p>Rolling back the trans protections given to students in Virginia 
public schools is dangerous. Adding to that a parental notification 
policy and barrier to entry for trans students whose parents affirm 
their identity names and pronouns shows this has nothing to do with a 
parent's rights but the targeting and dehumanizing trans students.</p>
<p>If a parent says yes to a student's name and pronoun change that 
should be enough to change the students name and pronouns on the rolls, 
in powerschool, and on student records which is the standard. Having a 
birth certificate and legal name change is a costly and lengthy process.
 This should not be the reason a trans child is denied a safe education.</p>
<p>Affirming trans students is not only what's best for the students but
 the community as a whole. 82% of trans youth have considered suicide, 
these rates go down considerably with access to gender affirming health 
care, and adults who are affirming and supportive. This creates an 
environment that gives all students the best tools for learning 
readiness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am also the parent of a trans son. For two years before my son came
 out I loved in fear of finding him dead when I went to wake him up 
everyday. He was in therapy and in distress until he finally came out to
 me and his father. We love and embrace him and his trans experience. I 
do not want another parent to live the nightmare I lived for those two 
years. Though it's been four since my son came out I still have 
nightmares about his distress and self harm that not living fully as 
himself brought on. It is truly hell on Earth.</p>
<p>We owe teachers the chance to teach without the added stress of 
potentially outing students to unsafe home environments and putting 
students in mental distress by forcing them to deadname their students. 
Teachers are there to teach and give social and academic tools for the 
students to carry into adulthood. This policy hinders that, and good 
educators will go elsewhere. That is will effect everyone in every 
community. Public School is the great equalizer and every student 
deserves an education that will prepare them for the future. This starts
 with quality educators and safe learning environments.</p>
<p>There is a safer way if we must insist on parental notification, by 
utilizing the help of school counselors and mental health professionals,
 and listening and honoring when parents fully affirm their trans 
children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set of policies is a huge step backward for Virginia — for its 
schools and larger culture. Upholding acceptance, dignity, and respect 
for all humans is always the "right" thing to do, yes (and these 
proposed policies do not do this). But it's also the <em>American</em> 
thing to do. This country was built on the concept that all citizens 
possess full rights and autonomy; these policies fly in the face of that
 ideal. They are anti-American, obviously bigoted, and clearly designed 
to pander to the far right, which craves more control of public school 
culture and what's being taught in schools, and how — essentially, so 
they can ban important, and thought-provoking literature and slice out 
inconvenient sections of history books (slavery, Colonialism), 
fundamentally teaching kids that as Americans we do not have to reckon 
with the past, but instead can move smugly forward with no understanding
 of how this country was built. As a mother of two in Fairfax Public 
Schools, I strongly oppose these policies, for our students and 
Virginia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly OPPOSE this policy. Multiple peer reviewed and published 
studies have demonstrated that trans and non-binary youth are at 
increased risk of suicide and mental health issues directly related to 
not being accepted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a school employee and a mother. In both of these roles I oppose 
this policy! There is no long lasting damage to allowing a student to 
use their preferred pronouns, name, bathroom, or sports teams but there 
is long lasting damage, sometime lethal, to denying this to a student! 
My students need acceptance and support. Denying them use of their 
preferred pronouns or name is a level of disrespect that no person 
deserves. Just in the past year I have worked with individuals who were 
born female but identify as male who go into deep depression, and have 
panic attacks every month because they feel their body betrays them. 
This has led to psychiatric hospitalizations to help them cope with the 
fact that their identity does not match with their current body. These 
students are not going to “change their minds” one day &nbsp;this is 
very real for them and to tell them they need to use female pronouns and
 their birth name would just be cruel and worsen their mental health 
symptoms. Thankfully they currently go to a supportive and inclusive 
school and I have witnessed them grow and blossom into confident young 
adults since they started here. THAT is what inclusion can do for a 
child and is exactly what I would want for my children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a huge overstep of government in a dangerous way.&nbsp;<br><br><br></p>
<p>I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS POLICY.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Virginia is an inclusive state. &nbsp;We should represent what is 
best about people and that includes all people. &nbsp;The idea you at 
promoting, that trans kids are somehow ‘other’ is repugnant to me. 
&nbsp;They are kids who deserve as much love and compassion as anyone. 
&nbsp;Maybe more so because they face such hatred. &nbsp;Your policies 
promote division, paranoia and fear. &nbsp;What are you so afraid of, 
Governor? &nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly, adamantly oppose the model policies. As the parent of a 
transgender child I know how important it is that the school environment
 is supportive and gender-affirming. The idea that schools would allow 
and/or REQUIRE the misgendering of my child, or force them to use the 
wrong bathroom makes me literally sick to my stomach. My child and every
 child in the Commonwealth deserves a positive, supportive, and 
affirming educational environment. If these policies go into effect, 
transgender children will suffer. These policies have nothing to do with
 the welfare children, and they must NOT take effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stop bullying trans kids. It’s disgusting. Stop being obsessed with 
kids and their gender identities. It’s creepy. You are lying to parents.
 PROTECT TRANS KIDS. LOVE ALL KIDS. This crusade against CHILDREN is 
abhorrent and the LOWEST and HOTTEST places in Hell are reserved for YOU
 and people who don’t support ALL KIDS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How can you study when you are mocked, discriminated against, forced 
to fear your schooling environment and your teachers, forced to stop or 
slow your development as a person? School should be a safe place for 
children, not a place of hatred towards minorities. Stop this bill, let 
kids live and be happy, happy with themselves, and learn to be good to 
the people around them, as others are good to them.</p>

<p>This a completely ridiculous policy. This would not have been passed 
for any other group of people. They directly stated that their job is to
 protect children, but they are directly creating legislature that puts 
children in harm's way. They are leaving the decision up to the parents 
when we have seen that not all parents have their child's best interest 
in mind. There is an entire department of the government that was 
created to protect children from their parents, and now we are leaving a
 major personal decision to parents who can be abusive or uneducated 
when it comes to trans rights. Also making children come out to their 
parents to get their basic rights addressed could put them at risk for 
abuse. School is supposed to be a safe place, and you are making it 
another place that children have to hide their true selves. This is a 
completely backwards idea that makes me ashamed of the state that I have
 decided to call home, and it scares me to think of what they may 
restrict of take away next.</p>

<p>Please don’t treat marginalized children as pawns. &nbsp;Studies show
 that LBQT children are already at higher risk for suicide - please 
don’t make this situation worse. &nbsp;Treating these children as 
“others” is a cruel policy, not befitting of the great state of Virginia
 in the 21st century. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The past few years have been unreal in the educational field.&nbsp; 
We spend more time talking about gender and pronouns than we do 
educating these kids.&nbsp; The classroom should be about educating 
kids, and parents should absolutely know what is going on in the 
classroom setting with their child.&nbsp; The school system has done an 
excellent job at eroding the trust of society over these social 
issues.&nbsp; The new rules aren't anti-trans.&nbsp; They simply spell 
the standards of conduct and give the parents back the right to know 
what is going with their minor child in school.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the new policy proposed by Governor Youngkin.&nbsp;
 It will cause irreparable harm to transgender children.&nbsp; I cannot 
imagine how distressing it would be for a transgender male child, who 
was born female but has consistently identified as male, to suddenly be 
forced to respond to his given female name or to be forced to use the 
girls' bathroom.&nbsp; Forcing a child to undergo this type of 
humiliation at school is beyond reprehensible-- it is downright evil, 
and governor Youngkin and his staff should bow their heads in shame for 
what they are going to do to this most vulnerable underage 
population.&nbsp; This willingness to hurt children for political gain 
is beyond my comprehension.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>These policies will harm our children more than help them! Children 
are curious by nature, let them explore in a safe environment before 
they reach adulthood, where it may not be as safe anymore.&nbsp;</p>

provides protection to girls in particular. Clear cut guidance also 
allows for little miscommunication between educators and parents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please stop bullying our kids. Focus on needed changes like: 
increasing teacher pay, increasing funding to our public schools, 
creating a free lunch program for every student in every school, fully 
staffing each school with nurses and guidance counselors and support 
staff.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>This attempted distraction doesn't work - parents/Virginians are 
struggling and need tangible relief - not made up culture wars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These proposed policies put the health and safety of trans students 
in Virginia schools at risk. It is our job as parents, teachers, school 
administrators and elected officials to do our utmost to provide a 
healthy and safe learning environment for ALL students. These highly 
immoral new guidelines will have the opposite effect and should never 
have been introduced as an option.</p>

<p>This draft policy change will do untold harm to our kids. Not only 
does it create an dangerous environment for trans kids, but it creates 
an avenue for weaponizing the school system against a kid that is 
accused of being trans, whether or not they are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I strongly, strongly oppose this reprehensible update.</p>

<p>Kids life is challenging enough right now. With new policies, 
children living under bigoted/intolerant households will lose the 
freedom to live their lives in peace outside of those households. Let's 
make life easier for all, not put up unnecessary hurdles. You don't have
 to agree, or even understand others to give them peace. Also, we don't 
need bs political stunts impacting our kids.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Governor Youngkin is endangering children </strong>

<p>Governor Youngkin’s policies are an extreme danger to LGBTQIA youth. 
LGBTQIA people, even if they are children, are the only ones who should 
make the decisions whether they will come out as LGBTQIA, when to come 
out, and to whom they will come out. Teachers, school administrators, 
peers, and even parents cannot make these decisions for anyone other 
than themselves, even children entrusted to their care, not least 
because they may (intentionally or unintentionally) expose another 
person to harm.</p>
<p>Requiring children to use restrooms of the gender they were assigned 
at birth, without &nbsp;whether they are safe in those restrooms, will 
embolden bigots to hurt LGBTQIA kids and/or force LGBTQIA kids to avoid 
bathrooms, leading to physical pain and even long term complications. 
LGBTQIA children, no less than anyone else, deserve to use restrooms in 
which they will be safe from bigotry, harassment, and violence. They, 
not the governor in his faraway mansion, should be the ones to decide in
 which bathroom they will be safest.</p>
<p>Requiring teachers and others to consult parents regarding the names 
and pronouns children want to use in school &nbsp;means that LGBTQIA 
children will be subjected to psychological and/or physical abuse, even 
expulsion, from any parents they were unsafe coming out to. A large 
percentage of LGBTQIA minors live houseless either because their parents
 ejected them from their homes or because they could no longer bear the 
psychological and/or physical abuse to which bigoted parents subjected 
them. A significant number of LGBTQIA minors are killed by bigots or 
commit suicide because they can no longer bear the psychological and/or 
physical abuse to which they are subjected by parents, other 
authorities, and/or peers. Governor Youngkin’s policies do not create 
more safety for LGBTQIA children, but more dangers. LGBTQIA people, even
 if they are children, are the only ones who should make the decisions 
whether they will come out as LGBTQIA, when to come out, and to whom 
they will come out. They, not Governor Youngkin, not their teachers or 
school administrators, are the best informed about the relative safety 
of their own individual circumstances.</p>
<p>Of course some LGBTQIA people make mistakes. A girl may think it’s 
safe to tell her mother she is trans, a boy may think it’s safe to tell 
his teacher he is gay, and learn too late that it was not actually safe 
to tell the person they chose. But it is far, far and away more 
dangerous to <strong>compel</strong> the sharing of personal LGBTQIA information without any regard for children’s safety, as Governor Youngkin’s policies would do.</p>

          <strong>CHILDREN HOSPITAL BOMBERS ARE ANT-TRANS</strong>

<p>Anti-Trans people keep voting for Republicans that have consistently 
stole taxpayer money wages, social security, and tax returns from most 
people. They love inflation and recessions because they hate 
marginalized people more than their fellow citizens, including 
themselves. They are traitors.</p>
<p>Anti-Trans people support CHILDREN HOSPITAL BOMBINGS, citing Matt 
Walsh and Chaya Raichik from Libs of Tik-Tok bombers, who have something
 in common with the UNABOMBER and the AL-QUAEDA Terrorist OSAMA BIN 
LADEN, who first did Bomb threats, Bombed locations, and did September 
11.</p>
<p>Fox News and anyone who supports Anti-Trans Legislation support 
Children Hospitsl bombings, and by extension, University Bombings, as if
 Mass shootings in these places weren’t bad enough. ANTI-TRANS people 
and politicians SUPPORT SHOOTINGS.</p>
<p>Anti-trans people are radical and dangerous enough to children that 
they vote for politicians who went on record thinking protecting 
grandkids mean SHOOTING GRANDCHILDREN. They are deranged and ignorant 
backstabbing liars.</p>
<p>These same terrorists are also associated with January 6th, like Fox 
News was, that had lead to the deaths of numerous people. Destruction 
and pooping on property. So know this, any company, any person, any 
politician who supports or legislates or donates to anti trans orgs will
 be associated with Children hospitals bombings by the public.</p>

        <div class="divComment">
          




<p>As someone who grew up in Virginia and spent all of my K-12 education
 in the Fairfax County Public Schools, I strongly oppose the changes to 
the Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in 
Virginia's Public Schools proposed by Governor Glenn Youngkin. All 
children, including transgender/nonbinary/questioning children, have the
 right to live their lives and go to school without fear of 
discrimination, bullying/harassment, or breach of their privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By outing students or forcing them to out themselves before they 
desire is an act of violence. Not only does it make them more vulnerable
 to harassment, bullying, discrimination, and gender-based violence...it
 also makes the student themselves more vulnerable to depression, 
anxiety, and suicidal thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are worried about other cis-gender students and their safety, 
there is NO reliable evidence that allowing all students to use the 
bathroom/locker rooms/other spaces that align with their gender identity
 results in any more violence than forcing students to use the bathrooms
 of their sex-assigned-at-birth. However, forcing transgender students 
to out themselves or disrespecting their gender identity will result in 
the injury and death of children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what you think about parental rights...a parent's right to 
know anything about their child does not supercede a child's right to 
live. Governor Youngkin, I encourage you to listen to the will of the 
Virginia people and NOT change the 2021 Model Policies for the Treatment
 of Transgender Students in Virginia's Public Schools.</p>

<p><br>I strongly oppose the new policy proposed by Governor 
Youngkin.&nbsp; It will cause irreparable harm to transgender children. 
&nbsp;Forcing a trans child to undergo this type of humiliation at 
school is beyond reprehensible-- it is downright evil, and governor 
Youngkin and his staff should bow their heads in shame for what they are
 going to do to this most vulnerable underage population.&nbsp; This 
willingness to hurt children for political gain is beyond my

<p>Protecting trans, nonbinary, and all LGBTQIA youth is an evidence 
based practice. We all have a responsibility to help grow happy and 
healthy children into happy healthy adults, and we know from scientific,
 academically rigorous research that affirming these key parts of their 
identifies is crucial to this goal.</p>

<p>With regards to the transgender guidelines, I’m wondering what is the
 percentage of students that they actually effect? I’m guessing it’s 
quite small. So it seems ludicrous to me that entire schools have to 
upend their curriculum to accommodate a few kids. I don’t remember high 
school being that inclusive. It’s no supposed to be. It’s a place of 
learning for everyone, and part of that learning is dealing with people 
who look and think differently than you. Stop making thing so easy for 
kids. They need to learn to deal with tough situations. Maybe if our 
schools were #1 in the nation, they’re not, we could have time for these
 discussions. Our schools should be worrying more about their primary 
job of educating our children and less about what pronouns they 
use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am a religious leader, a person of faith, and a follower of the 
Divine.&nbsp; A human being is worthy of all rights, protection, 
affirmation, liberty, and love.&nbsp; People who are Trans are human 
beings and need to be free to live their lives, fulfilling their unique 
identity.</p>
<p>Those who are elected to be our community leaders must uphold human 
rights and enact laws that support the worth and dignity of all.&nbsp; 
Children must be allowed to do their own naming and discover their own 
identities.&nbsp; The role of the government and schools is to protect 
children's growing up, offering safety, support, and respect.</p>
<p>I vehemently oppose the current efforts of the Youngkin administration to harm children by denying them autonomy and protection.</p>

<p>This bill will do nothing but harm children for expressing themselves
 and their needs. Stop vilifying trans people, and let kids do what they
 need to do in order to make it to adulthood. Trans bans kill kids.</p>

<p>This policy is bigoted, legally flawed, bullies children, and creates the very problems it seeks to remedy.</p>
<p>1) This policy defines "sex" as "biological sex" (which this admin 
thinks means assigned at birth) and therefore fails to afford students 
equal rights. Such a definition is legally flawed and inherently biased.
 To be clear - this policy is discriminatory on its face.</p>
<p>2) This policy creates the very problems this flawed policy seeks to 
prevent. It would result in boys who were assigned female at birth to 
compete with girls and go to girls' facilities.</p>
<p>3) This policy bullies trans and non-binary children, when studies show that those children need the most support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy is a shameful, partisan document that reflects neither 
reality nor policy needs. It exposes the VA GOP as an organization (and 
Governor Youngkin as an individual) bereft of real policy positions. 
Instead they seek to punish and bully the vulnerable.</p>
<p>This policy would be a disservice to all Virginians, parents, 
children, and non-parents. It would make the Commonwealth weaker and 
less inclusive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I strongly oppose it in this comment and I strongly oppose all the bigoted politicians who support it.</p>

<p>I am a transgender women who was taught in the Virginia Public School
 System several years ago, and it was already hard enough existing as a 
trans person in the hostile school system. This document, if it becomes 
official, will make life harder for trans kids who are just trying to 
live their lives as their authentic selves; and will almost certainly 
result in more deaths and more suffering as kids are made to bear the 
violent burden of bigotry. If you are a person with a beating heart and 
soul, then please oppose this document from becoming official.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">These policies are going to put children in
 abusive households in impossibly difficult and horrific situations. 
Make no mistake, this will directly lead to the suicide of kids who feel
 trapped. Suicide rates &amp; attempts in trans kids are much higher 
than any other demographic of child and the only way to help is to 
provide gender-affirming conditions.</p>

should not be forced to be someone they are not because of what a few 
sheets of paper say (sheets of paper that were made when they had no

<p>Regarding Proposed Guidance for Treatment of Transgender Students: 
&nbsp;The public school system in many jurisdictions has demonstrated an
 inability to protect the students in their care and has been reluctant 
to afford parents their natural god given right to care for their 
children. &nbsp;Schools have been guilty of forcing an agenda on their 
students, while keeping parents at arms length lest they object. 
&nbsp;The relative small number of students suffering gender confusion 
need parental support and appropriate professional &nbsp;counseling, not
 interference by teachers or school staff with a motive that is not 
necessarily in line with the best interests of the student. &nbsp;Some 
comments make reference to hate, but the hatred originates with those 
forcing unhelpful radical agendas on impressionable youth who need 
compassion and parental involvement. &nbsp; Bullying is already handled 
by appropriate policies and should be sufficient if enforced by 
administrators. Locker rooms and bathrooms must respect the privacy of 
students according to their biological sex. &nbsp; Sports programs must 
adhere to participation rules that respect biological sex. &nbsp;The 
biological differences between male and female are too profound 
post-puberty to allow for fair competition. &nbsp;Female competitors are
 at a disadvantage and should not be cheated from their fairly won 
achievements. This guidance supports common sense policies that protect 
all students and ensures that parents are kept informed and involved in 
the lives of their children.&nbsp;</p>

Virginia, I strongly oppose these model policies. Transgender people 
exist and deserve equal rights, and no amount of legislation or policy 
will prevent that from being true. I am raising my children to be 
respectful and understanding of differences, and to show compassion 
towards their fellow human beings, and I expect the same to be modeled 
for them in their educational setting. If implemented, these policies 
will only further harm and marginalize transgender children, and the 
policies themselves run afoul of current state law. The GOP is creating a
 narrative around transgender people that is nothing but lies and is 
intended to create panic and fear, just as they've done with critical 
race theory, immigration, etc. Trans kids have my full love, support, 
and acceptance, and I want Virginia public schools to be a place where 
all kids can grow and participate fully as themselves. Parents matter, 
and this parent strongly opposes the discriminatory radical 
Youngkin/GOP/conservative Hate agenda!</p>

<p>I oppose this legislation. I am a Christian, a member of the 
Episcopal church, and a mother of a teenager.&nbsp; This legislation 
removes protections for transgender students and those who wish to help 
and support them.&nbsp; This also targets transgender persons as 
unnatural and predators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They aren't hurting anyone! Let them explore who they 
are.&nbsp;Trying to force a child into a specific gender identity – 
either by denial, punishment, reparative therapy, or any other tactic – 
is not only ineffective; it is dangerous. It can do permanent damage to a
 child’s mental health. This legislation will lead to more trans youth 
being targets of hate crimes or trans youth becoming depressed and 
suicidal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My daughter has 2 friends who are transgender. One has a family that 
fully supports the transition and one whose family firmly does not 
support it at all.&nbsp; We have watched these 2 families deal with 
trans issues for nearly a decade. The supports at schools, and the SAFE 
environment at schools in Fairfax county have- LITERALLY-saved the lives
 of their children. For the family that did not support their child 
being trans, the counseling and care their child received saved them 
from suicide. While speaking to the mother, even though her faith does 
not recognize trans or homosexuality, she is glad that her child is 
alive, and she concedes that without the help of the school system, her 
child would have died.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This law will kill children if passed. Allow them the space they need to discern who they are, while they are safe.</p>

<p>This policy will likely lead to children self-harming or worse.&nbsp;
 It is the job of government, in my opinion, to protect those who are 
most vulnerable and this policy is will hurt them.</p>

<p>Leave political partisanship charged by radical ideology out of 
public schools, spaces, and forums. Children need to develop critical 
thinking skills in an open neutral environment to get the most out of 
their educational experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I oppose the new guidance which would forcibly “out” trans students 
and forbid them from being their true selves at school. I worry that 
this policy would put children who aren’t out to their parents at risk 
of being kicked out of their homes or worse. And I’m deeply concerned 
that these hostile policies will put vulnerable young people at risk for
 suicide. The best medical evidence shows that allowing teens to 
transition increases their chances of becoming a happy, well-adjusted 
adult. I don’t understand why Virginia would enact a policy that robs 
children of that chance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parents should always be involved in their child's education. The 
biggest aspect missing from the previous admin's model policy was that 
the school and teachers could make unilateral decisions about a minor 
child's "gender" without parent permission or notification. This new 
policy fixes that issue. Thank you for protecting our vulnerable 
children and affirming parent's rights.</p>

<p>This legislation was originally invented to protect transgender 
students from discriminatory behavior. Governor Youngkin has taken it 
and turned it into guidelines that do the exact opposite. These 
guidelines <em>restrict</em> our students rather than give them personal autonomy, <em>create</em> dangerous situations rather than avoid them, and <em>generate</em> conflict between educators and administration, students, and families rather than mitigate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why must we waste educators' and administrators' time by forcing them
 to police every student attempting to use the restroom? Why are we 
creating guidelines that, with their broad strokes and verbiage, 
essentially require educators to make a phone call home when even Thomas
 wants to go by Tommy? When did our schools become less of a haven for 
students, and more of a battlefield within which our students have to 
fear consequences for simply living their truth?</p>
<p>It is proven fact that transgender students are more at risk for 
depression and suicide than their cisgender counterparts. If we allow 
these guidelines to go into affect, we are not "giving parents their 
constitutional rights back". We are, in fact, not only stripping our 
students of the right to safely learn, but we are directly risking their
 health and wellness.</p>
<p>This is a direct invasion of privacy and an overextension of the 
rights of school officials. It is an overextension of the rights of the 
office of the governor, frankly. I strongly oppose this legislation. I 
do not believe it reflects the majority opinion of Virginians. I believe
 it is a reckless, frightening interpretation of government control, and
 should be reconsidered immediately.</p>

<p>This is a purely hateful policy, it achieves almost nothing but there
 is a near guarantee this will lead to trans children taking their own

<p>As a school counselor, I strongly oppose this new guidance.&nbsp; You
 say you want to empower parents, but how is rolling back protections 
for transgender students helping?&nbsp; When I started as a school 
counselor in my current district, I will never forget the moment I met a
 Dad who told me that his son was transitioning to a female.&nbsp; I was
 caught off-guard, but also impressed with the fact that this Dad was 
supportive of his child.&nbsp; I was also impressed with her transition 
because she felt safe to do so.&nbsp; She had an amazing Junior year and
 is currently a Senior.&nbsp; To imagine her having to deal with this 
stress right now as a Senior is unfair!&nbsp; Why are we singling out 
these students?&nbsp; Why does Governor Youngkin think it’s ok to roll 
back protections that haven’t interfered with these students 
educationally?&nbsp; Why are we even having this discussion right 
now?&nbsp; You are causing more harm then help!&nbsp; Stop being selfish
 and think of all parties involved.&nbsp; Virginia should be 
progressive, not regressive.&nbsp; Please leave our students alone!!!</p>

<p>I am totally behind Gov. Younkin on this matter. The parents should 
have control over this situation. As a former teacher, I am shocked at 
what has transpired over the last 15 years in VA. school systems and 
what is coming down from Richmond.&nbsp; You are what you are when you

<p>Thank you Governor Youngkin! This is exactly why we elected you! 
Parents have a fundamental rights to their childrens education and thank
 you for giving us the power back! Only a sicko pervert teacher would 
want to keep secrets from parents. And considering a new pervert/groomer
 is discovered almost weekly within our schools, this policy will help 
ensure that parents stay in the driver's seat, where they deserve to 
be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am tempted to refer back to the comment subject and say, that's it.
 That's the comment. But there is more than that. 64% of transgender 
students have reported avoiding a class because they feel unsafe. Is it,
 or is it not, the policy of the Commonwealth to guarantee all children a
 safe place to receive a public education? Because these policies will 
force students into a place where they feel unsafe and unsupported, and 
these youth will feel compelled to skip classes or leave school 
altogether - you are effectively denying them their right to an 
education by not providing them a safe place to learn. Policies that 
deny trans youth the right to express their true identity are policies 
that lead to more than half of transgender and non-binary youth to 
attempt suicide in the last year. The policies proposed will kill 
children. Meanwhile there is basically zero evidence to show that 
allowing transgender or nonbinary students access to bathrooms or locker
 rooms that match their identity will have any negative effect on other 
students, whereas there is very real evidence that forcing transgender 
youth to use facilities that don't match their identity puts them in 
danger of bullying and harassment, up to and including assault. Don't do
 it. Don't roll back important protections for transgender youth.</p>

<p>These proposed changes will be detrimental the mental health and 
general well-being of trans/GNC kids. &nbsp;They don’t need more rules 
about how and who they should be, these kids deserve love, support and 
kindness. &nbsp;These proposed changes are a HUGE step backwards in 
terms of LGBTQ+ rights. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The 2022 proposed model policies will harm trans youth in our 
Virginia schools. These kids need our support and gender-affirming care.
 The proposed policies are exclusionary and unnecessarily cruel to an 
already marginalized community. I strongly oppose these policies.</p>
<p>As a pastor, with trans kids in my congregation, I cannot support 
anything that would further hurt or demean these beloved children of 
God. As a mother of two children in Virginia schools, I want my children
 to learn in a school environment that teaches them how to respect and 
care for their fellow students by honoring their diversity and creating 
supportive, safe classrooms for ALL students.</p>

<p>Trans kids are among our most vulnerable, facing ostracization, 
bullying and shunning for being who they are. This policy to remove 
protection from one place they might feel safe is cruel. I strongly 
oppose it. Leave protections in place.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Strongly Oppose 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parent</strong>
        </div>
        <div style="clear: right">&nbsp;</div>

        
        <div class="divComment">
          




<p dir="ltr">To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 2022 Model 
Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and 
Parents in Virginia’s Public Schools. I am the Director of Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion for Waynesboro Public Schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I would like to raise serious concerns regarding these model policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In my locale, there are approximately 90 transgender and 
gender-expansive students. These policies would directly negatively 
impact their daily lives by denying them the ability to safely express 
themselves and be affirmed for who they are. These students are 
deserving of protection and support.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The suicide rate for transgender youth is already extremely
 high. 52% of trans youth seriously considered suicide, while 21% 
attempted suicide in the past year. This problem is preventable, but the
 new model policies would exacerbate the issue by denying students 
life-saving social transitions at school. The Trevor Project explains 
that “transgender and nonbinary youth who reported having pronouns 
respected by all or most people in their lives attempted suicide at half
 the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected.” This 
statistic shows that honoring students’ chosen names and pronouns is a 
crucial form of suicide prevention.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moreover, as much as we would like to imagine that all 
parents are supportive of their children no matter their gender 
identity, educators see that this is unfortunately not the case: 
Transgender youth are at a higher risk of experiencing homelessness, in 
part because they are often kicked out of their homes or abandoned by 
caregivers due to their trans identity. The Trevor Project states that 
“38% of transgender girls/women, 39% of transgender boys/men, and 35% of
 nonbinary youth reported housing instability and homelessness.” By 
requiring educators such as teachers and guidance counselors to 
automatically inform parents of their child’s transgender identity if 
the student comes out at school, the state puts young people in a 
position where they must either suppress their identities entirely or 
risk the roof over their heads.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In summary, these new policies would in reality deny 
students the privacy, dignity, and respect they deserve. Schools have an
 important role in supporting the mental health and safety of their 
transgender and nonbinary students. As an educator dedicated to creating
 learning environments where everyone can thrive, I urge you to reject 
or, at the very least, substantially revise these model policies to 
protect trans youth.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sincerely,</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kendra Jones Carter</p>

<p>When speaking about transgender people, we have to acknowledge that 
there are some people who will engage in violent behavior with them when
 unprovoked. Forcibly outing transgender people will make them targets, 
and can lead to loss of life. Also, preventing these transgender people 
from engaging in use of preferred pronouns and names only harms the 
transgender people. It does nothing to protect anybody and only serves 
to delegitimize transgender people's lives and existences. As for 
bathroom policy; if your fear is that someone will prey on others in a 
bathroom because of there attraction to the people in that bathroom, are
 you going to interrogate all students and force them to out their 
sexuality to you and then prevent homosexuals from using the bathroom of
 their preference? And more importantly, people go to the bathroom to 
use the bathroom, and we all go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy will only cause harm to transgender people and give peace
 of mind to bigoted people. It also brings up more questions, and 
possibly restricts more people from being able to live true and free in 
our society. Please do not enact this policy!</p>

<p>As the parent of public school children in Virginia, I strongly 
oppose these proposed 2022 model policies. The policies purport to 
support privacy, dignity, and respect for all students in Virginia. In 
fact, in the purpose it explicitly states "All students have the right 
to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment,
 or bullying." All students includes trans and non-binary students. The 
guidance document further states that "The Department is mindful of 
constitutional protections that prohibit governmental entities from 
requiring individuals to adhere to or adopt a particular ideological 
belief." The existence of trans and non-binary people is NOT an 
ideological belief. To say that teachers and staff are permitted to 
misgender a student because of personally held beliefs is not compatible
 with providing an educational environment "free from discrimination, 
harassment, or bullying" for all students. Section 22.1-23.3 of 
the&nbsp;Code of Virginia, held up in the guidance document under 
statutory authority and requirements, instructs that "The Department of 
Education shall develop and make available to each school board model 
policies concerning the treatment of transgender students in public 
elementary and secondary schools that address common issues regarding 
transgender students in accordance with evidence-based best practices." 
The proposed 2022 model policies are in direct conflict with well 
established evidence-based best practices related to trans and 
non-binary youth.&nbsp;These policies will harm children, and more 
specifically children who are already marginalized and often struggle to
 find acceptance in a world that increasingly uses them for political 
grandstanding purposes.</p>

<p>I understand that parents have certain rights in determining how 
their children are educated. However, no one has the right to demand 
complicity in abusing their child. The commonwealth of Virginia recently
 prohibited conversion therapy, with the following included in their 
definition: "any practice or treatment that seeks to change an 
individual's gender identity, including efforts to change behaviors or 
gender expressions..."</p>
<p>The new guidelines require teachers to help parents when they seek to
 forcibly change the gender identity of their children. This activity is
 illegal in our state and unethical under any circumstances. We can save
 lives by letting children pursue safe, social gender transitions as 
soon as they feel prepared to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The proposed policy is cruel. This isn't about the protection of 
children. It's a political ploy that will cause more damage to 
vulnerable kids who need support &amp; guidance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's also extremely weird for the government to be so focused on children's developing bodies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Who is asking for the government to impose onto parent's decisions, 
especially those that do not harm or effect others? This certainly isn't
 what I voted for. This isn't the party of small government, this is 
overreach. I strongly oppose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These model policies do nothing to provide a welcoming environment to
 trans children. Scientific research on this topic shows time and again 
that trans children are at high risk of suicide due to unwelcoming 
environments at school and the home. These policies do not protect 
parents, they only hurt children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no point to this other than Cruelty.&nbsp; And the extension
 of this thinking is intolerance and hatred and more invasion of 
privacy.&nbsp; It is enacting a restriction for a problem that does not 
exist except in the sad minds of those fearful people who cannot accept 
anyone "different".&nbsp; If it begins here, where will it end?</p>

<p>This policy will force trans kids to undergo undue scrutiny and 
places many in an unsafe situation where they may be forcibly outed to 
transphobic parents. Furthermore, children frequently look to adults as 
examples, and if they see adults bullying trans kids by outing them to 
their parents, singling them out from their cisgender peers, and 
deadnaming and misgendering them, then children will feel empowered to 
do the same. Do not be facilitators of child abuse and bullying. Oppose 
this dreadful and sadistic policy.</p>

policy, which violates of the spirit of<a rel="nofollow" x="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-23.3/"> Virginia's own law</a>
 "passed on a bipartisan basis, that required the Department of

<p>I'm a new resident to Virginia, but I have been proud to call the 
Commonwealth my home for the past months that I've lived here. This bill
 is disguising discrimination in the language of "religious freedom", 
and if families feel they truly must raise their children in cruelty, 
they are more than welcome to pull their children from schools and 
educate them as they see fit away from us in the 21st century.</p>
<p>I see no need to stain the name of the Commonwealth in service to discrimination and hatred against children.</p>
<p>I oppose this bill and the hatred in the hearts of those who have presented it.</p>

<p>Every child should have the right to be safe in school, safe from 
bullying by other children and safe from bullying by teachers and 
administrative staff. Youngkin is proposing changes that make all of our
 children less safe, including those who are not trans or nonbinary. Any
 time a government allows or supports oppressing a group of people, 
bullying and violence follows. Bullying is harmful to transgender and 
nonbinary kids, obviously. But it's also bad for the children and adults
 who do the bullying, making it difficult for them to acquire healthy 
social skills and maintain healthy relationships that help them get 
better jobs and avoid prison. <br><br>The American Academy of Pediatrics
 and many other medical groups oppose discriminatory policies like 
Youngkin's because they know that transgender and nonbinary children 
need support from their parents and communities. Transgender and 
nonbinary children who are loved and supported have a much better chance
 to not only survive, but thrive. We must stop Youngkin from turning our
 schools into places where some children are forced to hide and some 
children are encouraged to bully others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This proposed law is terribly unfair and immoral. To force these laws

 dangerous and unfair.&nbsp; We need to support trans youth and help 
them and anyway we can. Do not vote for laws that criminalize being

<p>As someone who had previously been seriously considering a move to 
Virginia, this policy now makes it an undesirable place to live. I would
 be ashamed to know that my elected representatives have so much hate in
 their hearts, and I see it as my duty to protect children, all 
children. What you propose is the opposite of protection. Transgender 
children not only exist, but deserve love, support through a variety of 
means, and a community that not only acknowledges their existence but 
celebrates it.</p>
<p>Anyone competent in simple and basic research who hasn’t been 
poisoned by conspiracy theorists can see that no young children are 
being given hormones or offered surgery, that puberty blockers have been
 used for decades in the case of precocious puberty with no ill effects,
 that only a small minority of children identifying as transgender 
change their mind and that they experience no damage from the freedom of
 self-determination,, that children who are supported are less likely to
 experience major mental health crises, and that the movement to mark 
the transgender community as groomers is nothing more than a 
self-revealing bid by the far-right to pin blame on a community they 
don’t understand. We have more cases of ELECTED MALE OFFICIALS 
committing assault and misconduct in single-sex bathrooms than we do 
cases of people pretending to be transgender for the purpose of 
assaulting women and girls in any same-sex bathrooms &nbsp;Ask yourself 
why that is, and what values the right holds that could lead to this 
phenomenon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, take a look deep down and ask yourself who is really 
protecting children, and who wants to keep their subjugated under their 
thumbs for further exploitation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Teachers are trained in child care and development. Respectfully, sometimes (emphasis on&nbsp;<em>some</em>)&nbsp;we
 know your children a bit better than you do and know what will be 
conducive to their learning. If a student is shrouded by anxiety over 
gender or body dysmorphia, it may impede their willingness to 
participate or to socialize, and eventually could lead to serious mental
 health crises. I’m certain you would rather have your child alive than 
dead because you couldn’t possibly let them have some say in their own 
identity at school.<br>Students are not accompanied by their parents at 
school (but rather are surrounded by their friends) and often act like a
 “truer” version of themselves. They are learning to be individuals in 
this setting, and learning what their boundaries are and what their 
identities and morals will become. Let them continue this exploration 
and trust that the teachers and administration will notify you if 
anything truly disturbing or out of line happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teachers care. Teachers want your children to succeed. We want your 
children to feel safe and comfortable in school, and we want to focus on
 the actual learning rather than worry about who is using which 
pronouns.</p>

<p>This new model policy does nothing to supposedly “protect parents

opposite. It will endanger trans kids and have a statewide chilling 
effect on kids discovering who in a safe environment. You have blood on

<p>This policy is cruel. &nbsp;All LGBT+ kids should feel safe in their 
schools. &nbsp;They should expect that their teachers and administrators
 will treat them with kindness and respect. &nbsp;They should expect the
 same from their fellow classmates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Allowing a teacher to mis-gender or deadname a student because of 
free speech rights is asinine. &nbsp;Would it be OK for a teacher to 
refer to a student with the “n” word because the teacher has free speech
 rights? &nbsp;An absolutely ridiculous contention.</p>
<p>This policy will harm students. &nbsp;It is misguided and mean. &nbsp;I strongly oppose this policy.</p>

<p>Hello Governor,</p>
<p>Your restriction of the rights and freedoms of transgender 
individuals is anti American and immoral. Your party claims to be the 
party of small government and freedom, and yet this restriction is big 
government and will cost more money to put these restrictions in place. 
You identify as a Republican, and your party supports the rights of 
Christians and their right to identify as such, which there is no 
scientific evidence that Christianity is biological. You are going to 
get innocent people killed, as the rate of suicide of transgender teens 
is way too high, and the cause of it is lack of support from parents and
 the community. Transgender people are shown to improve in their 
happiness level when they are shown support. Biological sex by itself 
does exist but there is nothing biological that forces women to act 
feminine and men to act masculine. Jesus would not support your 
transgression against the trans youth of Virginia.</p>

<p>This move is nothing more than an attempt to make the lives of LGBT 
youth more difficult than they already are. It is not even barbaric, it 
is calculated cruelty designed to force young people back into the 
closet because small minded angry reactionaries cannot stomach the idea 
that some people have wildly different life experiences. This is not the
 1820s, we should not shackle ourselves to the whims of a society that 
refuses to learn and grow.</p>

<p>I'm devastated by any threat to trans and non binary students, and 
heartbroken to live in a place where it is possible. Students should be 
treated with respect, called by their chosen name, and be able to 
participate in extracurriculars. Trans and non binary students need a 
safe space to thrive and build a future we all can be a part of, I am 
opposed to this action by our governor. &nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Stop this unevidenced pogrom against TGD youth</strong>
        </div>
        <div style="clear: right">&nbsp;</div>

        
        <div class="divComment">
          




<p>The proposed replacement of sensible, evidence based model policy for
 the treatment of transgender and gender-diverse children (TGD) in 
schools is without scientific merit and will lead to lasting harm and 
death. The proposal, offered entirely without evidential support, 
appears to be the result of politicians attempting to curry favor by 
sacrificing a vulnerable and powerless minority to bigots in exchange 
for their support. Not only should this proposal be rejected, everyone 
involved in drafting it should be subjected youth to Nuremberg-style 
trials.</p>
<p>The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) has 
released standards of care (SoC) based on a thorough review of the 
available evidence concerning TGD persons (<a rel="nofollow" x="https://www.wpath.org/soc8).">https://www.wpath.org/soc8).</a> This guidance is at odds with nearly every aspect of the proposed model policy.</p>
<p>Where the WPATH SoC regonizes the importance of respecting 
individuals' chosen names and pronouns, the model policy forces 
deadnaming and misgendering for some TGD youth and allows deadnaming and
 misgendering by any member of staff who feels like it.</p>
<p>Where the WPATH SoC reccomends that "institutional personnel 
establish housing policies that ensure the safety of TGD residents 
without segregating or isolating these individuals," the proposed 
guidance takes a separate and unequal approach, attempting to relegate 
TGD youth to either wrong-gender-associated facilities or isolated 
facilities that would only serve to stigmatize youth who use them.</p>
<p>Where the WPATH SoC notes that youth with unsupportive parents might 
require care from third parties, the model guidance aims to let bigoted 
parents prohibit TGD children from even expressing their gender identity
 openly at school. The SoC elaborates: "Helping youth and 
parent(s)/caregiver(s) work together on important gender care decisions 
is a primary goal. However, in some cases, parent(s)/caregiver(s) may be
 too rejecting of their adolescent child and their child’s gender needs 
to be part of the clinical evaluation process. In these situations, 
youth may require the engagement of larger systems of advocacy and 
support to move forward with the necessary support and care."</p>
<p>Promoting the opposite of an evidence-based policy will have 
disastrous effects for Virginia's TGD youth. Again, per the SoC: 
"Russell et al. (2018) found mental health improvement increases with 
more acceptance and affirmation across more settings (e.g., home, 
school, work, and friends). Rejection by family, peers, and school staff
 (e.g., intentionally using the name and pronoun the youth does not 
identify with, not acknowledging affirmed gender identity, bullying, 
harassment, verbal and physical abuse, poor relationships, rejection for
 being TGD, eviction) was strongly linked to negative outcomes, such as 
anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and substance 
use (Grossman et al., 2005; Klein &amp; Golub; 2016; Pariseau et al., 
2019; Peng et al., 2019; Reisner, Greytak et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 
2013). It is important to be aware that negative symptoms increase with 
increased levels of rejection and continue into adulthood (Roberts et 
al., 2013)"</p>
<p>This proposal clearly violates the Virginia code's requirement for an
 evidence-based policy. Since the proposed policy can only harm TGD 
youth for no conceivable benefit, it is reasonable to conclude that it 
commits that harm deliberately. The people who had anything to do with 
formulating this should be removed and forever banned from holding any 
positions of power: they have faced a moral test and failed 
spectacularly, whether by instigating this violence towards TGD youth or
 by failing to prevent it.</p>

<p>Restore the 2021 Model Policies. Transgender students are human 
beings and deserve to be treated with the same dignity and respect as 
all other students. Enforcing policies that prevent them from being 
addressed by their preferred name and pronoun and forcing them to use 
inappropriate restrooms is equivalent to enforcing policies the require 
that cisgender students be misgendered, referred to by names other than 
their own, and forcing them to use bathrooms they wouldn't chose to. It 
is child abuse. It is intentional cruelty. The 2022 Model Policies are 
far more guilty of forcing a political ideology on staff, students, and 
parents, than the previous one. They promote oppression and harm to the 
oppressed. They do no good for any decent or moral person.</p>
<p>There are no grounds for discriminating against transgender people.</p>

<p>As the parent of a trans young adult who came out at the age of 12, I
 know that if we'd lived under the cruel rules put forward by Youngkin, 
my son would not have survived. We also house three additional young 
trans adults who were made homeless by unsupportive parents years ago - 
and they were lucky to make it out alive. Life is incredibly hard for 
most trans youth - and small-minded bigots like Youngkin are just 
looking to score political points by painting a target on the backs of 
an already-suffering group of kids. Shame. Shame. Shame.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trans rights are human rights and children’s feelings and right to 
live as themselves should be protected. Human and lgbtqia+ rights should
 be taught and present in schools.</p>
<p>taking away kids’ rights to be themselves can be detrimental to their
 health. 82% of transgender individuals have considered killing 
themselves and 40% have attempted suicide.</p>
<p>if you’ve chosen to be a parent you have promised to love your child 
no matter what, so don’t reject them for trying to be who they are</p>

<p>Reversing existing human rights policy and law as proposed by the 
Governor will harm students. There are substantial mental health 
benefits associated with using the pronouns and names people prefer. 
Intentionally disrespecting pronouns s d deadnaming students will 
increase depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation.&nbsp;<br>Simply put,
 respecting the preferred names and pronouns of students are powerful 
suicide tools. Do not inflict harm on our children by reversing 
established rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rights of students not wanting to use the same bathroom/locker

their rights matter anymore.</p>
<p>What qualifies a teacher to tell a student they are gay, trans or anything.</p>
<p>Portions of the government are trying to remove parents from raising their own children. It has to stop.</p>

<p>It is deeply inhumane to target trans and nonbinary people who are 
simply trying to live safely as their full selves. It is also deeply 
sinister and harmful to present queer people of ANY age as threats, 
particularly those who are most at risk of violence and stigma. I 
vehemently oppose this policy -- we should be protecting trans and queer
 people, not demonizing them and denying them fundamental rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose Governor Youngkin's policy regarding Trans 
kids.&nbsp; These policies hurt children. The only reason he's doing 
this is so he can run for President in 2024.&nbsp; It's sick to use kids
 as political props to score points with the Fox News crowd. Do your 
actual job instead of touring around the country propping up election 
deniers and coming up with these ridiculous policies!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello, I would like to comment on the proposal for transgender policy
 in our school system. &nbsp;No human has ever changed their gender or 
altered it in the slightest. Chromosomes determine gender at conception.
 One's gender is expressed in every cell in one's body. There's no way 
to change one's chromosomes. So the scientific reality is that the 
'transgender' movement is a FRAUD. Kids should not be taught the 
falsehood that their gender is fluid or flexible.</p>
<p>An even more serious problem is the fact that Biden's administration 
has okayed&nbsp;"gender affirming" surgery. This is a very dangerous and
 damaging procedure that should be outlawed in all cases. There's no way
 to affect one's gender through surgery! That's an absolute fiction. All
 surgical alterations are COSMETIC ONLY! And they have many negative 
side-effects, including sterility. Please outlaw this surgery!</p>
<p>Thank you,&nbsp;Joe Silva</p>

<p>As a Virginia resident I would like to express my absolute disgust 
with the newest education policy guidelines regarding transgender youth.
 I am sickened to see the safety and education of Virginia’s children 
being scarified to score cheap political points. This is a blatant 
attempt by the state to invade the lives of marginalized children and 
their parents. This is also a blatant attack on the public school system
 which has always been founded on being open and accommodating to 
all.&nbsp;</p>
<div dir="auto" data-removefontsize="true" data-originalcomputedfontsize="16">This
 is change in policy is nothing more than attempt to further demonize 
and politicize the very existence of trans youth in Virginia schools.</div>
<div dir="auto" data-removefontsize="true" data-originalcomputedfontsize="16">The
 Virginian government and the department of education should be ashamed 
of itself for favoring the political ambitions of our governor over the 
safety and education of our children</div>

<p>I'm writing to voice my strong opposition to this measure which will 
only bring further harm to already vulnerable and marginalized kids. We 
should be doing all we can to protect young trans people in meaningful 
ways by welcoming their full participation in school and society, and 
guaranteeing their access to affirming care. Curtailing the rights and 
abilities of trans kids, their parents, and doctors foes nothing to 
protect anyone, and will ultimately cost lives. &nbsp;The only reason 
for this kind of legislation is to build political power on fear and 
ignorance, using conservative voters as pawns in much the sane way the 
kids themselves are being used. It is craven and vampiric, and will be 
remembered as corrupt and manipulative. Build a legacy of real care, not
 phony concern, and trash this bill.</p>

<p>Forcibly outing kids to their parents is a terrible and dangerous 
idea. This will not help trans youth and will only help transphobic 
parents in harming their kids physically and emotionally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why are you going out of your way to ostracize a bunch of emotionally vulnerable young people who've done nothing wrong to you?<br><br>This
 is a myopic, cynical plan that does nothing but turn a bunch of young 
people who need support and help into "the other." Everyone involved

<p>Let trans children handle their own identity and continue to support 
their transitioning. The fact that you insane monsters continue to 
meddle in the affairs of children’s sexuality is proof to me that 
children’s genitals are always on your minds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Policies that take back the existing rights of children are cruel and
 politically-motivated, not done with evidenced-based consideration of 
the best interests of the children. Youngkin’s proposed policy will hurt
 children’s mental and physical health, and potentially lead to the 
cascading effects of bullying, including increased suicides, all of 
which can be avoided.</p>

<p>As a Virginia mother, I strongly oppose this policy. Trans kids 
should be respected and supported in a learning environment. This is a 
backwards policy that seems hateful and geared towards earning 
&nbsp;political points with bigots to further the Governor’s national 
aspirations, not what is best for the school children in the state. 
Virginia’s kids deserve better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new policy returns some balance to the treatment of all children 
in our education system. The requirements for recognition of transgender
 status are not onerous, but rightly involve the parents as well as the 
child. These policies recognize that non transgender students also have 
rights - including the right to bodily privacy. No general locker room, 
group showers, lodgings, or other such facilities should require a child
 of one sex to be exposed to or in front of a child of the other sex, 
regardless of the chosen gender identity. The 2022 policy factors in the
 nature of many school facilities and the need to protect the individual
 rights of all students. In addition, the requirement to include parents
 in any accommodations is a protection to the child - just as requiring 
parental consent prior to medical treatment or even being out of school 
for an activity.</p>
<p>The 2021 policy was geared to enlarge the role of teachers in guiding
 children - regardless of parental choice. This needed to be changed for
 the good of families.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think Governor Youngkin's proposed policy affecting trans students 
in Virginia schools is a vast overreach. Why is it the business of the 
governor to discourage anyone, at any age, from experimenting with their
 gender expression? Trans people aren't hurting anybody, they're just 
trying to live their lives. If the parents of their fellow students have
 a problem with their own non-trans kids being exposed to this- a fear 
that I don't think is reasonable to act on, you can't hide the world 
from your kid forever- they can change schools or homeschool. I'm 
willing to bet my next paycheck that the problem is all the parents' and
 the kids don't care much; kids are resilient and open-minded. Maybe the
 parents making such a big stink about the possibility of their kid ever
 coming into contact with a trans person are just afraid they won't have
 complete control anymore over whose humanity and dignity their child is
 capable of seeing and accepting. Trans people are PEOPLE. Governor 
Youngkin should not seek to restrict individual liberty like this, 
especially in our PUBLIC schools.</p>

<p>This policy is harmful to trans kids and families. I am a youth 
development researcher with first hand knowledge of how these types of 
policies contribute to depression, anxiety, and suicidality for trans 
students. All students deserve to feel safe, respected, and experience a
 sense of belonging at school. Teachers and school staff also deserve to
 be able to provide a positive school climate for their students. I 
absolutely oppose this harmful legislation.</p>

<p>it costs zero dollars to allow trans kids to be themselves. it costs 
zero dollars to call trans children by the name and pronouns they want. 
there is absolutely no reason for these guidelines except to reinforce 
hate. trans kids deserve hope and respect.</p>

<p>The proposed regulation is equal parts poor policy, poor 
understanding of the law, and poor execution of the VA constitution. 
Forcing agents of the state- in this case, educators and school staff- 
to put the lives and well-being of children at risk in the name of 
"parental rights" is at best tactless, and at worst, evil.</p>
<p>There are likely enough emotional and experiential arguments being 
levied against the proposed regulation, hence I will rely on the law. 
The rule change in question would violate principally 1) Section 1 of 
the Virginia Bill of Rights, and 2) United States Supreme Court 
Precedent vested in Tinker v Des Moines, and affirmed in Morse v 
Frederick.</p>
<p>Section 1 of the Virginia Bill of Rights states that "That all men 
are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent 
rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, 
by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment
 of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing 
property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety." Effectively,
 all persons entering the "state of society" of Virginia, have the 
ingrained, and un-assailable right to life, freedom, and whatever brings
 them happiness, and safety. Does the Governor's Office truly believe 
that this right does not extend to students in the classroom? Is denial 
of the right to use the facilities one most feels comfortable with the 
fair exercise of a Virginian's guarantee to liberty, and personal 
safety?</p>
<p>How would the Governor feel if he were a Virginia student, and the 
school and his parents were insistent by calling him by his middle name,
 "Allen?" Would Allen- sorry Glenn- sorry, Governor Youngkin sit back 
and let that continue? No, the argument that would be made before courts
 is that his name is "Glenn," he goes by "Glenn," and he's not "Allen 
Youngkin," even though his parents might think so. Are you truly to deny
 Virginians the basic freedom to identify themselves, as guaranteed- 
again- by your own bill of rights. "All persons have the right to 
freedom and whatever brings them Happiness and Safety." What if, in this
 hypothetical, Youngkin felt unsafe using the name "Allen," or if it 
brought him great personal or emotional distress? "Allen was the name of
 the uncle that got drunk one night and ate my favorite horse." Why 
would we insist that we retraumatize Governor Youngkin in remembrance of
 his beloved pony? Is that not the state denying him his basic rights?</p>
<p>The next argument: The Supreme Court of the United States has twice 
affirmed the rights of students in similar circumstances as per Tinker 
v. Des Moines, and Morse v. Frederick. In <em>Tinker</em>, SCOTUS found 
that students have the right to "express their rights to free speech, so
 long as it does not interrupt the due course of education." This was 
modified in&nbsp;<em>Morse,&nbsp;</em>because "bong hits 4 Jesus" likely
 interrupts the due course of education, in that having a banner that 
says "do drugs" at a school-sanctioned event, interferes with the due 
course of learning. Likewise, forcing a student to use the facilities or
 the name- that as stated above, would cause serious emotional harm- 
interferes with that student's ability to participate in the due course 
of education.</p>
<p>I know where the counterargument will come from, and allow me to 
dismantle it in the clearest way I can: a transgender or gender 
non-conforming student using the restroom that closely corresponds with 
their identity, or using the name and pronouns that do the same, does 
not interfere with the school's ability to teach. The people who say 
"well what about people who lie about being transgender so they can be 
creeps in the bathroom" appear to lack the facilities to understand that
 they'll be able to tell when someone's lying about their identity so 
they can be creeps. A trans kid that wants to pee is a trans kid that 
wants to pee. The state (commonwealth, whatever) has no business in 
needlessly over-policing that student on the assumption that they MIGHT 
be stating that to do something malicious. Or does the presumption of 
innocence not apply to transgender Virginians? The over-policing of a 
student's identity represents the clearer and more present threat to 
their ability to learn. The state is more than capable of adequately 
identifying and punishing people who abuse the system, and the 
assumption of good faith.</p>
<p>As far as the "role of the parent" goes in this argument, the 
aforementioned court cases affirm the dual roles of the state in taking 
care of children when educating them, and what the roles of parents are.
 The assumption is that the school will take care of a child's basic 
needs- food, shelter, safety, and the rights granted to them by state, 
local, and national law. The reality herein, is that the role of a 
"parent" changes when a child is at school. Fulfillment of basic needs 
still applies- but because the school is an agent of government, it must
 afford the student the rights that government guarantees: life, 
liberty, health, and safety among them.</p>
<p>To use the earlier analogy, Governor Youngkin's parents insisting 
that his name is "Allen" is of no issue to the state, when it is out of 
the jurisdiction of the state. However, as soon as the Governor steps 
into a public school, he is, by extension, under the care of the state. 
Hence, the state cannot levy discomfort and emotional harm to him by 
insisting that his name is "Allen," forcing him to re-live the trauma of
 finding his succulent slow-roasted pony that fateful day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, the regulation proposal is bad. Like, really bad. For these basic reasons:</p>
<p>1) it will cause undue and unnecessary harm to students that&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) likely violates the VA bill of rights, insofar as it denies the rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and</p>
<p>3) likely violates SCOTUS precedent in that the policing of a 
student's identity denies the right to an education as affirmed in&nbsp;<em>Tinker&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Morse</em>.</p>
<p>As a point of personal privilege, I would like to address the 
Governor directly. Mr. Youngkin, I don't know who is in your ear saying 
that you can become a Senator, or a Cabinet Official, or the President 
of the United States, but they are lying to you. Yes, they are lying to 
you. You're a wealthy guy- I'll give you that, you'll probably see more 
money in the next couple of years than I can even imagine touching in my
 lifetime. But you need to fire the consultants who say that pandering 
to the most vile elements of the right-wing, and levying violence on 
children- children in MY community- is politically good for you. You are
 not going to do well in the 2024 or 2028 Republican Primary. You're 
going to finish a distant second or third place in New Hampshire on 10, 
11 percent, because the GOP heart wants what it wants- and it wants 
Donald Trump again, or it wants Ron DeSantis. Hell, maybe even Ivanka or
 Don Jr. It doesn't want Glenn Youngkin. They're going to see you as an 
out of touch rich guy from a liberal state. Yes, Virginia is a purplish 
state, but you're going to be given the same treatment as my governor, 
Larry Hogan. You're already a RINO. You're already old news, a guy who 
just doesn't get it. Spare yourself the embarrassment and the guilt, and
 take a lesson from your Republican Governor colleague a state away. 
Heed the advice of a Spencer Cox, an Eric Holcomb, hell even a Doug 
Burgum, in understanding that there is no business of the state levying 
due harm on the people it is called upon to serve. Bear witness to the 
good nature of everyday Americans, who just want people to live their 
everyday lives. Be the better person, or be swallowed by the maelstrom 
of evil that envelops all who think they can tame the jungle that is the
 eschatology of the 25 percenters. The choice, ultimately, is yours, 
Governor. Don't hurt kids.</p>

<p>There are well-documented linkages between discrimination and health.
 Almost half of all trans people will attempt suicide at some point in 
their life. This policy will put vulnerable transgender minors in direct
 harm by outing them to their families and allowing them to be 
misgendered repeatedly in school, a place that is supposed to be safe 
and welcoming for all. I vehemently oppose this. - a concerned mental

<p>This essentially provides a legal basis for discrimination against 
trans youth, without any benefits at all beyond appealing to the 
narrow-mindedness of certain people. I hope that lawmakers are sensible 
enough to avoid a bill that discriminates against children.</p>

<p>Is it not bad enough that laws require schools to discriminate

Trans women are women, trans men are men, it’s time we treat them that

 hear from them, not just parents that pretend to know them better than 
they know themselves! Shame on you, Glenn!</p>

<p>Affirming gender identity saves lives. I have two transgender 
children and they are thriving since they transitioned because they have
 been supported. This policy will lead to isolation, mental health 
distress, and—as we have seen again and again—violence from others or 
against themselves. Please protect our children’s lives by rejecting

<p>I, a student at a VA school, vehemently oppose the trampling of trans
 student rights in Virginia schools. These measures will only hurt 
students, and further isolate trans kids from their parents and peers. 
Students have a right to the self determination of their gender, as well
 as when they want to come out to their parents. Students also have a 
right to be called the name of their choice, as well as go by the 
pronouns they feel comfortable with. This is fundamental to a students 
self respect, and self image. Sic Semper Tyrannis. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As a former student within the state of Virginia, I must say that the
 current trend towards freedom of personal expression would have been a 
great help during my grade school years. It would have been a weight off
 my mind, and would have saved myself and others years of anguish and 
heartbreak. But if the positives of leaving people be won't get through 
to you, as I suspect they won't, please consider this warning:</p>
<p>The idea that the banning of transgender rights would be helpful to 
students is extremely flawed. This could kill. As one who knows the fear
 and anguish that come with having to hide oneself, I am warning that 
this could push people over the edge. The amount of oppression these 
people get already can lead to depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc., and the 
added pressure may entice them to take drastic personal action--namely, 
suicide. Are the deaths of children so insignificant to you that you'll 
even take action to increase them?</p>

<h1>This is stupid.</h1>
<p>Why are we wasting our time on this as policy? My legal name is 
Christopher. People ask me all the time if I prefer to be called Chris 
or Christopher. Now, I truly don't care what people call me. My friend's
 mom's legal name is Anita but she goes by Charlaine. That's how I know 
her. It would be dumb if my place of work instituted a rule that says 
"you MUST call people by thier legal names". Because people often don't 
go by thier legal name. This policy specifically targets transgender 
youth and tells them that... Even though there are many examples of 
people being allowed to be called by a Nickname... Because of who they 
are, they are not afforded that same luxury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, if I started calling Glenn Youngkin by "she/her" 
pronouns, I'm sure she'd be quick to correct me and ask me to use her 
preferred pronouns of "he/him". Which I am glad to oblige if asked. 
Because, it's just polite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's STUPID we are spending ANY government resources or my tax money 
on this. The government is LITERALLY BULLYING AT RISK YOUTH. Get bent.</p>

<p>It’s hard enough to be different in school. Don’t make it dangerous to be gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I came out in high school and even though I was physically attacked 
the teachers, principal and school board would not help me saying that I
 didn’t have “special rights” as a gay person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They considered safety a special right not available for non- straight people. I don’t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t let Virginia lose the progress that we have made.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am very supportive &amp; proud of Governor Youngkin for the actions
 he is taking regarding the Transgender &amp; CRT nonsense so prevalent 
in the schools today. I agree wholeheartedly that girls use girls 
bathroom &amp; same for boys. No government or teacher has the right to 
tell a child that they were really born the opposite sex. Parent’s and 
parent’s along have the rights to guide and instruct their children on 
private matters regarding sex not a school or the teachers. Teachers are
 in the schools for one reason and that is to teach our children the 
basis subjects (history {true history good and bad not the made up book 
on when slavery started} reading, how to write, all the subjects to make
 our children ready for a career in the future. God blessed the parents 
with their children to love, give them a religious upbringing, guide, 
kind toward others and teach them to be the best person they can be in 
the world. &nbsp;Teacher’s are in the classroom to teach and have NO say
 in any other aspect of the child raising. Keep your politics and sex 
belief OUT OF THE CLASSROOMS.</p>

<p>I support this policy only because the one put forth by the last 
administration and the one adopted by the Albemarle County School Board 
is simply overreach and insane. This is certainly not an easy topic with
 one fix (e.g., this policy), but I agree with Youngkin's policy here. I
 do think that parents should be informed only if they ask or if this 
new identification may be contributing to poor performance in school. 
There should be resources provided for students that don't truly feel 
safe in expressing themselves but this is NOT our teachers. Focus on 
teaching not identity!!!</p>

<p>Youth deserve to be treated with the respect you would give any

<p>I’m sure there are plenty of messages here about why this is a 
terrible position and the dangers that it will evoke for our most

extreme measures you will lose any voters who fall anywhere other than 
the extreme right. If you want to hold onto moderate conservatives stop 
this nonsense immediately.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I fully support these policies. I also support a zero-tolerance 
bullying policy, which is already in effect. Governor Youngkin, please 
do not reverse course. This is an anti-bullying issue, not a 
bathroom/locker room issue. Stay the course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Governor Youngkin created an absolutely terrifying policy regarding 
trans youth that all VA schools will be forced to adopt in 30 days 
unless it is stopped. &nbsp;<br>This reversal of rights for trans and non-binary youth is dangerous and concerning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The title might seem inflammatory, but that's exactly what the 
proposed trans policy for schools will do. It will lead students to 
abusive, unsafe homes with unsupportive parents, and it will lead many 
to suffer such extreme physical and mental health violence that they may
 be killed, by others or by themselves. Governor Youngkin's attempt to 
skirt the actual law in Virginia disgusts me as a Virginian parent of 
soon to be 2 children. Stop ignoring actual laws in Virginia, and 
protect trans students LIVES. Murder will be on the hands of anyone who 
forces these policies into place.</p>
<p>And prepare for a MASSIVE lawsuit against these ILLEGAL policies.</p>

<p>Do you know a transgender child/teen? &nbsp;If not, move on. 
&nbsp;Did you grow up with social media as part of your middle school 
and teenage years? &nbsp;If not, you can’t fully appreciate what 
children face today. &nbsp;Let them be who they are. &nbsp;Have you seen
 mental health statistics? &nbsp;My children are not transgender but 
they have transgender friends. &nbsp;And mental health is real, it is 
hard, and the system is not setup for self service navigation on how to 
get support. &nbsp;The changes proposed will clog up an already broken 
system and leave blood on the hands of those who support it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy is sickening and could be responsible for the deaths of 
children. Forcing teachers to out trans students to abusive parents is 
terrible and the administration should strongly reconsider issuing this 
terrible policy. We need to respect students and parents, not put 
students in danger.</p>

<p>Research is provided to show that the new policy is not aligned with the empirically founded evidence based best practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% reported suicidality. <strong>A
 protective factor for transgender youth that mitigates this risk and 
reduces suicidal ideation and suicide attempts&nbsp; is school 
belongingness </strong>(Austin et al., 2020).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>Transgender and nonbinary youth whose schools prevent them from 
using the restrooms/locker rooms that best matched their gender 
identities were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted, <strong>26% for transgender males and&nbsp;149% for transgender females</strong> (Murchison et al., 2019).</li>
<li>
<p><strong>28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted suicide in the past year</strong>.
 In fact, when pronouns are respected, transgender youth attempted 
suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns 
respected (Trevor Project, 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transgender adolescents experience significantly disproportionate levels of childhood abuse </strong>compared
 to cisgender adolescents and experience greater levels of homelessness 
as a result of being kicked out or abused (Thoma, 2021).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fewer than 2.5% of transgender youth re-transition to cisgender (Olson et al, 2022).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a parent and school counselor in VA's public school system, I 
STRONGLY OPPOSE this policy. Transgender students exist, they always 
have, and they always will. These policies will only harm this already 
vulnerable population of youth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The idea that parents, by default, would be excluded from life 
altering decisions of their minor child's life flies in the face of all 
that is known about what makes a child healthy, happy and 
successful.&nbsp; It is widely known, and frequently stated, that 
children with involved parents succeed both academically and 
psychologically over those children where parents are not 
involved.&nbsp; That said, to paint all parents as unsupportive in this 
particular issue by default (guilty until proven innocent) is both 
destructive and dangerous to children.&nbsp; Parents are the best and 
only long-term support mechanism for their children.</p>
<p>If there is fear that a parent might be a danger to their child 
related to any issue, then the school district should report that parent
 to social services.&nbsp; The school system is not qualified or trained
 to deal with this level of psychological issue.</p>
<p>I support this model policy as it puts parents back in charge of raising THEIR children, not the school system.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Strongly Opposed: These policies do not yield a beneficial outcome for students</strong>

<p>The model policies do not represent my values as a parent of three 
school-age children in Virginia public schools. They are not backed by 
any credible research that demonstrates any public benefit. While many 
parents have opinions on this point, it is vital to apply expertise. 
Gender, like many other aspects of humanity, has been academically 
studied with rigor for many, many years. No gender research supports 
policies like these as a means of producing a beneficial outcome. 
Importantly, these model policies center the desires of parents, not the
 benefits to students. The only outcome of these policies is to make 
parents happier. They do not describe any actual harm prevented or 
benefit created for the students.</p>
<p>When it is time to choose policies on mathematics (e.g., which topics
 to include at what age and how to teach them) we don't ask a 
representative set of parents for their opinions. We seek and use the 
recommendations of mathematicians and educators with verifiable 
credentials. Gender should be treated the same way: we should seek out

<p>I will start by stating outright that there are certain things i do 
not agree with in my own community. I am a transgender female, 56 years 
old, have lived a full and rich life, raised a family, lost an oldest 
child, experienced a lot in a relatively short number of years. I grew 
up in a conservative "Christian" home, attended church weekly, billy 
graham revivals, Montreat,&nbsp; attended Wheaton christian high school 
etc... I also at the age of 9 loathed my male genitalia to the point i 
would self mutilate. i would in secret put on my sisters clothes and 
makeup in the bathroom and then in a panic leave it all behind me. My 
mother spent many years trying to help me and find out why i was having 
so many difficulties in school and life but in the family i had there 
was NO disclosing what i was experiencing. I lived with a secret for 
decades that tormented, set me apart from my peers, kept me constant 
isolation and made me feel as though there was something seriously wrong
 with me.&nbsp;<br><br>It was not until i was 35 when a business 
associate informed me that they would be taking a medical leave of 
absence and when they returned they would be known as Jessica, not John.
 That conversation was the first time i heard the word transgender. She 
was an executive vice president of software development for a company 
who's software i had been using for years. I had no idea you could be a 
professional in this American corporate world and make that kind of 
change. I went home that day and looked up the word "Transgender" and it
 was like the light came on for the first time in my life. The more i 
read, the more i researched the more i found myself in the words that 
were put before me. The feeling i had was utter relief and explained so 
so so much about what i had been experiencing since i was a child.&nbsp;
 I had been in therapy, seen psychiatrist as a child who i "kind of" 
disclosed what i had been feeling but never before had i understood that
 there was an actual word for the experience i had been living with for 
so many years that entirely described my experience. That was where it 
started for me and i met with a psychiatrist who specialized for years 
in experiences such as mine. I decided i would transition and live my 
life in an entirely different way that i had lived in for years. She 
told me the best transition was the longest transition which were words 
that guided the rest of my journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know who i am, i have a full understanding of my biology, i know 
that i am not biologically speaking a female but that has no bearing on 
how i chosen to live out the rest of my life. I medically transitioned 
in 2014 at the age of 48(i think) and i have not looked back since. 
Sadly, i will admit to still living with a degree of isolation but i 
have found that is due to our society and the stigma and 
misunderstanding that exists about what being transgender is and an 
almost unwillingness to learn and practice empathy. People's discomfort 
is often outwardly projected with a hostile response to my existence 
which i see and experience regularly. When i first began transitioning 
the most important thing to me was being able to "pass" as a female so i
 could just blend into society. Today, that is no longer important to me
 and the discomfort others feel in my presence sense is not my problem 
it is their problem. I am an attractive woman, with a rich soulfulness, a
 good heart, a generous and giving spirit and am. fun, sporty, a titch 
butch, with a still masculine voice. None of that matters however 
because I'm not living my life for you, i'm living my life for me. I 
have to live in my own skin and feel good about myself and that can't 
depend on your acceptance or capacity for empathy or understanding or 
kindness. That's much easier for me today at 56 but i can GUARANTEE YOU 
it is not that easy for younger people and children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have a choice to make, you can either support those who have far 
less experience with life and are far more vulnerable or you can be a 
boulder in their path and make their experience more difficult and 
uncomfortable than it already is. I can assure you having spoken with 
dozens if not hundreds of parents who have kids that are struggling with
 their gender whether they be non-binary, non gender-conforming, trans 
masculine or feminine their experience in i'll say most all cases is 
real, it is not to be dismissed, minimized, made fun of or mocked. I 
look to political figures as those who take on one of the greatest 
responsibilities and that is to be a PUBLIC SERVANT to all their 
constituents. Not just those they side with or visa versa. Our 
politicians today are failing miserably, we have forgotten how to have 
conversations and hold other responsible for being able to hold 
conversations that seek to find solutions that work for everyone. As a 
society we have become consumed with only what is good for me and 
forgotten about caring how others might feel, to have an understanding 
that not everyone shares the same experience or are living the same 
way.&nbsp; I also do mean that in an overall sense, we're all 
guilty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, in this case as a public servant of a state who has a 
responsibility to all the people of said state i would surely hope you 
are not a boulder in an already difficult path for a young child, of any
 age. I would hope that you can create an environment where you can 
drive difficult conversations for yourself and others that can be 
constructive and not destructive or made to create an environment of 
perpetual misunderstandings. I would hope that you can actually be a 
leader of a state where you take into account that people's experiences 
are different and not everyone fits into some cookie cutter pretty 
package and remember at all time that your position affords you a great 
opportunity to be a real public servant and actually serve all those who
 reside in your state and not just those you petition to obtain their 
votes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kids need support, all kids need support... even those who are having
 a white picket fence life where everything fits together nicely but for
 those whose lives are already not working out that way... they too need
 support and not and they definitely do not need others who old so tight
 to their own idealogical prejudices against themselves and even their 
parents. I assure you having lived this experience for 40+ years and 
both sides that it is not some pretend fairytale lie these kids are 
telling, it is real and you stand to make a positive or negative 
difference in their lives and unless you are the type of person who just
 doesn’t give a sh-t about anyone other than yourself than work to be a 
positive influence and work to find solutions not just slam the door 
shut because that’s what “your” voters want you to do.</p>

        <div class="divComment">
          




<p>Reading some of the comments in this space leaves me with a few burning questions:</p>
<p>1) What is lost or risked when transgender students are allowed 
access to resources and spaces in a way that matches who they are? 
&nbsp;At the school where I work, the obvious answer of our community's 
experience is: NOTHING. &nbsp;We were quite worried before we had our 
first openly transgender student but, honestly, it has been a completely
 seamless "change." &nbsp;And we're a boarding school... &nbsp;I think 
we adults need to recognize that today's youth live in a world where 
identity and choice are and should be up to the individual. &nbsp;The 
judgment of society does not exist in the same way that it did even 10 
years ago. &nbsp;We should not take them backward or use our outdated 
concerns to shape the future...</p>
<p>2) How can we justify making changes that we know will negatively 
impact mental health? &nbsp;All of the research shows that transgender 
youth are at much higher risk of mental health issues, abuse, and other 
endangering situations. &nbsp;The more we normalize transgender youth, 
the less likely these issues are to continue. &nbsp;The more we point 
fingers and force people into situations where they don't feel 
comfortable, the more issues will continue to arise. &nbsp;Let's be 
kind!!</p>
<p>Come on, Virginia... &nbsp;Let's not turn back the clock.</p>

<p>Your bigoted anti-transgender crusade will do considerable harm to 
the mental health of already vulnerable LGBTQ children. There will be 
increased depression and suicide. &nbsp;It’s cruel and evil and has no 
place in a modern, civilized society.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Schools are meant to be a safe space for all, and using personal 
religious beliefs as a defense is unethical. The current model policy 
was researched and written using best practices and input from 
professionals in the fields of mental health and pediatrics. These 
changes based upon the unfounded fears of an uneducated and 
narrow-minded few would equal a further fall away from protecting all of
 our youth. Please keep Virginia safe for all our children and students.</p>

<p>I strongly, strongly oppose the 2022 proposed model policy. According
 to the Trevor Project's 2022 national survey on LGBTQ youth mental 
health found that 45% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting 
suicide last year, and more than half of transgender and nonbinary 
youth. More than 1.8 million LBTQ youth seriously consider suicide each 
year in the US, and at least 1 attempts suicide every 45 seconds. 
Another recent study found that Transgender teens are 7.6x more likely 
to attempt suicide than their peers (university of ottowa study, 2022). 
Suicide is the 4th leading cause of death for adolescents from age 15 to
 19.</p>
<p><strong>Trans and Nonbinary youth are vulnerable, and it's our job to
 support them - not to shame them, bully them, or force them into boxes.</strong>
 This policy is cruel, and will result in irreparable harm for trans and
 nonbinary kids and their families, including loss of life. Please don't
 do this to our trans and nonbinary kids. They need us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gender identities are not just chosen, and censoring information 
about gender identity will not prevent youth from realizing they are 
trans- it will just make them more fearful and MORE AT RISK FOR MENTAL 
HEALTH ISSUES. The only thing Gov. Youngkin’s proposal would achieve is 
ensuring an extremely unsafe environment for marginalized kids and let 
transphobic, suppressive parents control their lives outside of the 
house too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This proposal was written on the blatantly false idea that children 
can be “”groomed”” into being trans- most people who come out as trans 
have felt different for as long as they remember, but need education 
about the topic to express that. Protecting trans kids’ human rights is 
just as important as any other students’.</p>

<p>Overlooks the rights of the student if they do not want something 
that was disclosed to school to be shared with their parents. Things may
 be shared in confidence and they should stay that way. The student can 
share with their parents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy is an effort to vilify an already marginalized group to 
distract from the governor's complete lack of actual education policy. 
The only agenda is to dismantle public education. Using trans kids and 
their families as political pawns is dangerous and disingenuous. We 
should be supporting all students and their families. Leave your 
Christofascist beliefs out of our schools.</p>

<p>Any rules that deny ANY individual the right to self-identify is by 
very definition hateful.&nbsp; Demanding a person conform to a misguided
 government-mandated sense of identity cannot be allowed to stand.&nbsp;
 It is, in short, child abuse.&nbsp; And those who encourage any laws 
that would be abusive to a child should be removed from office and 
prosecuted.</p>
<p>It's okay to not want it for yourself, but there is no legal basis to deny it to others.</p>

<p>Children are not merely extensions of their parents, and have the 
fundamental right to be their true selves and not punished by the school
 systems for doing so. &nbsp;This proposition is cruel, unjust, 
discriminatory, and would further promote hate towards trans and LGBTQ+ 
children in schools. &nbsp;These children are not the ones harming 
others, but are rather the ones being harmed, especially by propositions
 like this. &nbsp;Children have a right to use the bathroom that beat 
fits themselves, use the correct pronouns for them, and be addressed and
 be able to dress as their truest selves. &nbsp;Promoting anything that 
states otherwise is hateful, abusive, and downright evil. &nbsp;I 
strongly oppose this proposition for these reasons.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this legislation.&nbsp; Protect transgender kids 
and all kids - this legislation harms transgender children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This legislation is wildly contradictory.&nbsp; While in one section 
it states that it intended to protect each unique child, it also says 
that transgender people have no right to how they are treated.&nbsp; It 
states that no personal ideologies can be pressed upon another person, 
but then says that transgender people cannot express themselves fully 
because of other people's opinions on who they are.&nbsp; This policy 
would allow the opinions of individuals to dictate the lives of 
others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not freedom.&nbsp; I am a parent, I am a Christian, and I 
believe that transgender individuals should be able to express 
themselves fully, confidently and proudly.&nbsp; I also believe that 
anyone looking to press their beliefs upon others by not acknowledging 
the individual has violated their rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This legislation encourages the discrimination of transgender 
people.&nbsp; I believe that Virginia has an obligation to protect and 
support EVERY student.</p>

<p>This policy needlessly puts professional and judgment-minded 
counselors and teachers between students and parents when students are 
navigating their own identities. It’s fairly simple; a household with 
parents who desire a strong relationship with their children and 
involvement in their childrens’ lives on these highly sensitive issues 
already have the knowledge they need from their son or daughter to 
navigate these unique and delicate decisions. The parents who would 
require a school to call them and inform them of the information their 
son or daughter shared with a counselor or teacher do not offer an 
emotionally safe environment at best, and a physically safe environment 
at worse. The consequence of these needless and over-bearing rules will 
harm people under the age of 18, and will not improve anyone’s lives. I 
am beyond frustrated that this administration continues to insert itself
 into the personal lives of Virginians. Schools are not pushing agendas 
around trans issues, they are simple teaching tolerance and acceptance 
to students at large, which means an adolescent who is being bullied at 
school or just desires to be themselves can not seek the help of their 
guidance counselor who will be required to tattle on them. It is well 
documented that gay, queer, and trans students have a higher suicide 
rate than any other adolescent group. Trans adolescents are less than a 
percent of the population, and so for the amount of time and resources 
this administration has wasted on their insistence that this is somehow a
 “problem” is absolutely ludicrous. Enough is enough. Focus on improving
 education outcomes in curriculum and stop worrying about the private 
parts and private situations within our public schools and in peoples’ 
homes.</p>

<p>I strongly support these changes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>School divisions have to disclose sensitive student information to 
the student, the student’s parents and school personnel with "a 
legitimate educational interest or when required by law."&nbsp;</li>
<li>School divisions can only refer to each student using the name in 
the student's official record or an associated nickname. The same goes 
for pronouns.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Students will need parents' permission in writing if they want to be
 referred to under a different name or pronouns than what's in a 
student’s official record.</li>
<li>School divisions can only change a student's legal name or sex if a 
parent or eligible student submits a legal document or court order 
backing up the change.</li>
<li>Students can only use bathrooms that correspond to their sex.</li>
</ul>

<p>What the child wants to be called affects no one—but them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a makes a child feel valuable affects no one—but them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With some of your new rules you will make children very sad. And 
evidently, that’s your goal. It doesn’t matter who they are, rich or 
poor, this will hurt some children. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Youngkin, your admin is the worst thing that’s happened to Virginia since I moved here 8 years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you cannot do anything to help women, children, the poor, the 
elderly, and our working families, just keep campaigning for other 
tyrants and remain silent. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How many live might be saved if parents were more involved in their 
children's lives.&nbsp; This goes from gun violence to sexual 
orientation.&nbsp; I understand that sometimes the parents may be the 
problem, but if they don't know about a concern how can they assist 
their child?</p>

<p>As a trans nonbinary parent with 2 children, I am strongly opposed to
 this bill. It is hard enough being a trans child right now, we do not 
need to make it any worse. This bill will only result in further pain 
and harm. Let our children be themselves without trying to control what 
scares you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the new possible law.&nbsp; This is what is wrong 
with all the kids now.&nbsp; Never in my life have I seen or heard of so
 many kids talking or committing suicide, but since all this pronoun 
stuff started, this is what is wrong with these students now. The 
internet is also is a big problem. These kids are our future and they 
are messed up because of all this stuff. I have taken my grandchild from
 public school.&nbsp; So many teachers are in it for the money and not 
our children anymore.&nbsp; I am ashamed of how our society is messing 
up our kids.&nbsp; Shame on anyone that agrees with this.</p>

<p>As a parent in Virginia, I am truly appalled by this policy. It 
serves only to facilitate an environment of hostility for kids. That is 
who we are discussing here. The administration is using children for 
political gain, and its unethical and immoral. Those who are trans deal 
with all sorts of stigma in schools, so your decision is to make it 
worse? Why? For incredibly rare cases that have occurred? For brownie 
points to run for higher office? Glenn Youngkin, as a Christian, you 
should be ashamed of yourself. Everyone that is for this policy should, 
if they call themselves Christian, drop that title. Because this is not 
Christlike behavior in any manner. Also, all you are really doing is 
keeping parents from understanding their children. By isolating these 
individuals, you drive them into feeling ashamed, which means they wont 
discuss this with their parents. Instead, they will just stop talking to
 them. You make it seem like trans children and adults are abhorrent, 
when they are just not your version of normal. Party of family values 
alright...</p>

<p>This will negatively impact one of the few safe spaces a child may 
have. Trans kids may not have parental support and are at increased risk
 of violence, salf-harm, and homelessness among other impacts, 
especially if you take away one of the few welcoming spaces they do 
have. Do not do this. This policy helps no one and hurts childden.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The growing movement of fascism disguised as anti-groomer rhetoric 
towards an entirely innocent group of marginalized individuals as you 
IGNORE the prospering predators in churches all over Virginia is 
embarrassing. You care more about subjecting marginalized queer people 
to being crushed under your boot than children already being harmed, 
actively, in the systems you promote today. It's not about the children,
 it's about money in your pockets and targeting and endangering already 
threatened groups. What a joke.</p>

<p>Dear Governor,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would say you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself but I know 
you have no shame so I wouldn't expect you to show a shred of decency or
 empathy to anyone that is different from you. Your proposed policies 
will have gut-wrenching consequences on young trans kids and students in
 VA and around the country. You are using innocent lives as a wedge 
issue to drum up support with your base and create a problem where there
 is none. Trans and nonbinary kids and students deserve to be supported 
and allowed to be the fullest version of themselves in school and 
everywhere else. No one is harmed by allowing them to do so. Schools are
 supposed to be a safe haven where young people learn and grow and 
become who they are meant to be. The rates of self-harm and suicide are 
incredibly high amongst LGBTQ+ youth. This issue is deeply personal to 
me. I lost my partner to suicide a few years ago at just 25 years old 
because of bullies like you who use religion to harm, ostracize and 
demonize people who are just trying to be themselves. We are not a 
theocracy. Our constitution specifically calls for the separation of 
church and state. To impose the hateful religious beliefs of a small 
minded, backwards and vocal minority on students in Virginia is 
antithetical to what this country was founded on. Interesting that you 
can abandon your constitutional conservativism when it serves you 
personally. When fear mongering and scapegoating an entire group of 
people to appeal to hateful MAGA republicans. You are a coward and the 
harm that comes from this will be on your hands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is any issue to address, it should be the harassment and 
bullying of LGBTQ+, especially trans/non-binary kids, in schools. Look 
at any piece of research and you would clearly see that the group you 
are targeting is already disproportionally affected by violence and 
harassment. You are contributing and exacerbating that with these 
policies. Your pathetic attempts to harm kids who are just trying to 
live their lives is despicable and it is not reflective of what Virginia
 values can and should be. You should be working to make sure the 
Commonwealth is as safe as it can be for every individual, no matter how
 they might identify.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent federal court decisions have upheld protections for transgender people, including a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>2020 U.S. Supreme Court decision, written by&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" x="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/neil-gorsuch-gay-transgender-rights-supreme-court/2020/06/16/112f903c-afe3-11ea-8f56-63f38c990077_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_9" target="_blank">Trump appointee</a>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" x="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/neil-gorsuch-gay-transgender-rights-supreme-court/2020/06/16/112f903c-afe3-11ea-8f56-63f38c990077_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_9" target="_blank">Neil M. Gorsuch</a>,
 that determined that civil rights law barring sex discrimination covers
 transgender people. What you're doing will not stand and it is clearly a
 political stunt to bolster support from your most hateful, 
small-minded, and uneducated supporters. You will not win this fight 
because trans folks and the LGBTQ+ community more broadly are some of 
the most beautiful, resilient and powerful people in the universe and 
collectively we will make sure you do not succeed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am shocked and so disappointed by Virginia legislators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a legal/democratic level this is, pure and simple, taking away 
rights.&nbsp; How is that democratic.&nbsp; That is legislated morality 
for the majority and discarding the minority.</p>
<p>On an ethical/moral level this is meant to punish, further 
maginalize, and put in "harms way" young people who are true to their 
selves, teachers who are there to support, and all of these.&nbsp; When 
compassion is missing for one, it is diminished for all.</p>
<p>Finally, you are asking all Virginian's to participate in this denial
 of freedoms and deliberate punishment&nbsp; of those who are taking the
 brave and dangerous path to move us beyond "either/or" thinking...and 
that is a developmental growth step.&nbsp; Apparently, Virginia 
legislators value more political regression to moral and political 
development...and development makes some, generally those who hold 
power, uncomfortable.&nbsp; Imagine the discomfort of going to school 
each day knowing that not only could you be hurt but if you are the 
entire system will come to the protection of those who hurt you.</p>
<p>It is beyond sad...it is immoral.</p>

<p>Gender identity is not an ideology. Also, you should be aware that 
gender ideology is not taught in schools, nor is CRT. Gender affirming 
medical care is never advised in schools. What is provided in public 
school is support and compassion for students who are struggling with 
gender identity, family crisis, and bullying. All of which stem from an 
ideology you are now teaching which is only one type of student deserves
 to be treated with respect and dignity. It is hypocritical to call 
gender identity ideology, yet force others to prescribe to the ideology 
of discrimination in this policy. I am extremely saddened that Governor 
Youngkin continues to use Virginia students as pawns in his political 
agenda. Shame on you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello! As a Virginia resident who has frequent interactions with 
transgender students in my county, this policy will only isolate and 
harm them more. These students want to be accepted by their peers, 
teachers and families and this policy does not support that. Please 
protect and respect our trans kids!</p>

<p>The number of young people who say they identify as something other 
than their birth sex is off the charts. While there may be some that 
truly do feel this way (and good for them), the majority are attention 
seeking. So many see that this is a special interest group getting 
attention and to many that is extremely attractive (akin to getting 
"likes" on Facebook or instagram). &nbsp;These ridiculous policies (by 
Northum) create undue work for teachers who should focus only on 
teaching. You can be kind to a kid who identifies as something other 
than their birth sex without having policy; let that be the 
social-emotional learning. So many people quote statistics (the same 
GLSEN study) that states without some policy that 50% of people who 
claim to be transgender or non-binary will commit suicide...but do you 
think a policy like this will prevent that? Of course if we cater to 
that group, raise them up and continually "celebrate" their mere 
existence, I'm sure some will feel fabulous and turn away from that 
horrific act. But some, by the sheer fact that they have gender 
dysphoria may not and that is horrible. But making everyone in the world
 cater to a small few people &nbsp;by compelling speech of others, 
changing the landscape of competitive sports, etc is asinine. This 
statistic is like comparing the suicidal rate in those taking 
antidepressant....these people are depressed and have lots of heavy 
stuff going on..of course they that rate will be higher in that group. 
same with folks with gender dysphoria. Just be nice to people, you don't
 have to agree with what they do, but be nice.</p>

<p>Governor Youngkin's proposal is nothing short of an attack on trans 
kids motivated by his own hatred and desire to be president. It's not 
going to do anything but force families with trans children to flee 
Virginia if they can or send their children into traumatic a environment
 every day. Instead of attacking trans kids to further his own ambitions
 maybe Governor Youngkin should try actually helping people for the 
first time in his life</p>

<p>Believe it or not, trans kids exist. But because you’re so insistent 
on believing that such a thing couldn’t possibly happen, you decided to 
make a policy that doesn’t allow trans kids to do something as simple as
 using the bathroom. Shame on you. Are you really so reactionary to 
pronouns? Absolutely pathetic.</p>

<p>If you had any hope of getting new seats during the midterms or 
winning a new election, this will take it away. People from Maryland, 
New York, New Jersey, DC and other very, very liberal areas are moving 
en masse into Virginia to try to find better living situations due to 
high inflation and the increase in remote work. Even people from 
California are moving all the way here to Virginia. Virginia has been 
purple-leaning-blue for a while. Doing this now will ensure the midterms
 are heavily slanted towards liberals and progressives, and ensure you 
won't be able to do a single thing the remainder of your time in office,
 as well as ensure your loss in the next election. You should have 
waited until after the midterms, gotten some moderate votes to help you 
land seats in the midterms, and passed this the usual way. Trying to fly
 past actual legal precedent <img src="VirginiaRegulatoryTownHallViewComments1_files/blackbox.gif" alt="black box" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: middle">es everyone from EVERY party off.</p>

<p>This policy will end up literally killing trans kids. It has been 
shown that people (including adolescents) with gender dysphoria live 
happy, fullfilling lives when they are able to be their authentuc 
selves. Which means allowing them to use whatever bathroom matches their
 gender- whether or not that differs from their assigned sex at birth- 
and reffering to them by the pronouns that match their gender. When 
those things are withheld from transgender people, especially minors, 
over 40% of them end up committing suicide and/or engaging in self harm.
 Just giving them those basic things greatly reduces the chances of any 
of that happening</p>

<p>Forcing trans children to be outed to their parents, which may not be
 safe for them, will lead to more teen suicides, as those children are 
unable to be themselves, and made to feel that they are somehow wrong 
for wanting to be themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not a single educator in the commonwealth is trying to “stick it” to 
parents by calling a kid what they want to be called. Many of these kids
 do not feel safe at home. Many of these kids are just trying to make it
 through the day. I don’t support any policy that would terminate a 
teacher for calling a kid what they want to be called.</p>
<p>I understand the concern for parental rights.&nbsp; Which is why I am
 so baffled by the policies in states such as Texas that would open CPS 
investigations on parents who allow their children to explore 
transitioning with their doctor and psychiatrist. The parents there can 
re-write history textbooks, but are losing their rights to raise their 
children how they want if the state has a problem with it. Virginia is 
not Texas.</p>

<p>Imagine getting angry at kids for expressing how they feel...</p>
<p>God makes no mistakes, unless it's something your small brains can't 
comprehend, then it's a horrible mistake and the kids should be 
ridiculed and discriminated against in a space that should be safe for 
them.</p>
<p>No love like Christians hate...</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this disgraceful proposal. Students deserve to feel
 welcomed and accepted in schools, but this proposed change to the model
 policies would create a climate of hate for thousands of trans and 
gender-fluid students in Virginia. If the Department of Education moves 
along with this proposal, it would be enacting state-sponsored 
discrimination against already vulnerable students.</p>

<p>The fact that we are having this conversation in Virginia in 2022 is 
appalling. I strongly oppose this discriminatory policy that have been 
put before us. While the Republican Party is all about rights and 
freedom, they completely leave out of the conversation those that their 
harmful policies affect the most. Yes, parents have rights but the 
education system has a job to care for, protect and educate our youth. 
If parents don’t agree with what their district policies are they have 
the right to remove their child from the public school system. Far to 
many times have I had to sit and listen to a student cry because their 
parents don’t believe who they truly are and it’s heartbreaking. To 
enact such a policy as this one would do nothing more but harm our trans
 and non-binary students. Suicide rates and bullying would dramatically 
raise in our state. I beg our representatives to take a close look at 
this policy or come into our schools and see for yourselves before 
taking any action</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this guidance and call on the VDOE to reject it. As
 the product of the Virginia public school system, and as the parent of 
three students of the VA public school system I firmly believe we have 
an obligation to protect and support the children in the care of our 
educational system, especially those who are at greater risk of 
harassment, discrimination, and violence like our transgendered and 
LGBTQ+ students.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the mother of a transgender teenage daughter, I see how policies 
like this affect trans kids every day. My daughter has two supportive 
parents at home, but not all LGBTQ+ kids are that lucky. A policy that 
"outs" kids to their unaffirming and unaccepting parents will have 
deadly consequences. For some kids, school is their only safe place. 
This policy would get rid of that safety. You cannot call yourself 
pro-life and support such a dangerous policy.</p>
<p>Using a student's preferred name and pronouns harms no one. You don't
 have to understand or even "agree with" a student's identity to call 
them by their preferred name and pronouns, and nobody else's religious 
or other rights are infringed by requiring that they address a student 
by their preferred name and pronouns. If trans students' names aren't 
respected, why stop there? Nobody should be allowed to be called a name 
that differs from their full legal name on their birth 
certificate.&nbsp; No Mike or Katie - only Michael and Katherine. If 
this sounds absurd, that's because it is absurd. Just call students by 
their preferred names. It's not that difficult.</p>
<p>As far as bathrooms and locker rooms, there are zero documented cases
 of a student faking being transgender for the sake of accessing the 
opposite gendered bathroom or locker room in order to assault someone. 
Using the excuse that boys will say they identify as girls to attack 
girls in the restroom is baseless and presumptuous. Being transgender is
 not correlated in any way with being a sexual predator. Parents and 
education professionals/officials making wild accusations like this have
 caused my daughter such anxiety about using the restroom - ANY restroom
 - at school that she has developed an eating disorder. She is so afraid
 of being confronted and accused of something she would never do that 
she will just go all day without eating or drinking anything in hopes 
that she doesn't need to use the bathroom at school. People who support 
this policy bullied my child into an eating disorder.</p>
<p>What it all boils down to is this: trans kids already deal with 
enough ridicule, hate, unfounded accusations, and anxiety over their 
every move being scrutinized by those who "disagree with their 
lifestyle." This policy only compounds all of these things. It wouldn't 
protect anyone or give all parents authority over their children's 
education. It's cruelty just for the sake of being cruel. Be better than
 this.</p>

<p>If a queer child chooses not to come out to their family, there is a 
reason. They are protecting themselves from rejection or 
violence,Perhaps even losing their home. I know transgender people who 
were outed in high school in the early 2000s and became homeless when 
their parents rejected them. I myself did not come out until I had 
housing secured away from my family. Everyone needs community, and so 
often queer people do not find it with the family they’re born into. 
This needs to change. But we cannot rob queer people of our chosen 
family, children the ability to confide inTheir peers and trusted 
support of adults in their lives like teachers. These lifelines help 
children survive.If a queer child you chooses not to come</p>

<p>Im someone of moderate political stance, and this sort of thing is 
exactly what your average American does not want to see in school. 
Education is not supposed to be political; when students go to school 
they shouldn’t have to worry about the regime and political culture in 
which they are receiving their education. We shouldn’t try and impose 
any sort of political morality, government institutions are supposed to 
be apolitical.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the party of "freedom" the Republicans seem hell bent on 
controlling the lives of people who do not conform to their ideal norms.
 You say you want to create a world where children are safe and free 
from abuse (physical and psychological) from their parents and 
guardians. If you force the school system to report to parents that a 
child is asking to be identified other than what is listed you are 
setting that child up for abuse. Stop trying to control other people and
 help set up a State and Country where people feel free to be who they 
are without the condemnation of the Government. It's time to truly 
embrace FREEDOM for all not just freedom for those who think like 
you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for some common sense on the new transgender model policy. 
This will protect kids and defer to adults on major decisions.&nbsp; 
Totally support.</p>

<p>Virginia is not going back. We will not harm children for the 
Governor to engage in a political demonstration of intolerance to curry 
favor with extremist bigots so he can run for President.<br><br>We won't
 harm children by subjecting them to intolerance in an attempt to apply a
 contorted religious standard to children in a public school system.<br><br>We
 won't reject the gender identity of anyone in public schools. We won't 
fear monger or introduce onerous legal obstacles to acknowledging and 
respecting the names and gender identities of anyone associated with 
public school in Virginia.</p>
<p>We won't put one life at risk by enacting these hateful policies. 
Virginia law protects Virginians from abuses of human rights and these 
policies do not supersede the law.</p>
<p>As a parent, Virginia is not acting in my interest or protecting my 
rights in any way with policies of hate and intolerance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kids deserve to be loved and respected for who they are, and to be

Let the kids be who they are.</p>

<p>I oppose the new guidelines concerning transgender students. Every 
student regardless of race, creed, nationality, political persuasion, 
gender, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity deserves to be 
treated with dignity and respect. This is total government overreach 
that will trample over the rights of students, teachers and staff, and 
parents. These new guidelines are harmful to students that are 
transgender in terms of safety and mental health. Schools should be a 
sanctuary for all kids to feel safe, included, and loved not demonized 
or scapegoated. This is politics being played by Glenn Youngkin in a 
clear delusional aspiration to possibly run for president in 2024. Our 
schools are facing a crisis in teacher shortages and other crises 
impacting our schools but instead of Glenn Youngkin focusing on fixing 
the ACTUAL problems facing Virginians, he much rather play politics and 
harm our most vulnerable kids who just wants to be loved, accepted, and 
be their true authentic selves. These new guidelines are not only 
harmful and dangerous to our kids mental well-being but they're also 
immoral and unjust. I hope school boards across our state reject 
Youngkin's divisive and hate-filled policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please support an ordered and healthy society. The education of 
Virginia’s children should not encourage nor support disordered 
ideology. If a child is uncomfortable or miserable he should not be 
encouraged or coddled to change himself through surgery or medication to
 mutilate a healthy body. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a lie that children will kill themselves if they are refused 
medication or surgery to mutilate their bodies. Children who are 
miserable before drastic changes will remain miserable after 
irreversible surgeries and medication protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These children should not be bullied or abused for their confusions. 
Within the schools they should be served with kindness and compassion. 
They should not be coddled nor be &nbsp;catered to in their 
delusion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relieve these tender children from their burdens of confusion by not 
affirming their disorder but by affirming our compassion to bringing 
order to their minds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The very people that are pushing these type of policies are the same 
type of people that would send their children to conversion therapy 
camps if they were gay or trans. The Republican Party is really losing

its foot on the lgbtq throats due to hatred.</p>

<p>Gender identity is not an ideology. Allowing kids to explore their 
identity and become true to who they are is such an essential part of 
life. If we deny the ability to explore ourselves, we deny the ability 
to live our lives authentically and to their fullest.&nbsp;<br><br>Denying
 the option and forcing these BS policies under the name of 
"Christianity" and religious politics is absurd. Forcibly outing 
children to their families significantly increases the chances of 
suicide or self-harm and brings in a whole new dynamic of their families
 not accepting them for who they truly are; this brings on more abuse 
and, in some cases, a very unsafe living situation. Not to mention the 
number of children forced to become homeless because they were kicked 
out after their parents were informed that they were trans and want to 
live as authentically as anyone else.&nbsp;<br><br>I have never felt 
anything but welcomed and safe in the LGBTQIA+ communities; I have 
several friends and family members in the LGBTQIA+ community. Seeing 
them live authentically brings a massive smile to everybody's faces and 
makes the world more welcoming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 2022 Proposed Document specifically states parents rights on what
 is allowed in schools as it should be as opposed to a push of one 
political view.&nbsp; All students/children should be treated with 
respect most definitely.&nbsp; But parents must be respected as well in 
how they raise their children and what they want the schools their 
children attend to teach.</p>

<p>Once again, Y is stirring up chaos and playing to his base by 
attacking defenseless children. This policy change will cause more harm 
to transgender students by ostracizing them. As a retired educator with 
27 years of experience, I know many transgender students who would be 
harmed by this. Keep politics out of the classroom and let experienced 
educators do their jobs. We want a welcoming environment for all 
students, not one that excludes the most vulnerable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can dress this up as a parental rights issue,&nbsp; but what 
about my parental rights to have a welcoming educational environment for
 all? Spin it as a religious issue.&nbsp; My religious beliefs call for 
loving all, no matter who they are. The religious right is 
neither.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is very clear to anyone paying attention that the Republican party
 is not interested in the well-being of our children after they exit the
 womb. It is not at all shocking to me that Governor Youngkin is 
continuing to persecute kids who are already marginalized, to further 
his own political career. It is anti-American, unchristian, and 
completely shameful. What is more shocking to me is that the party of 
big business does not recognize how this will affect the reputation of 
our state, and hurt us economically. It is not just an immoral move, 
it’s a stupid one. Legislating hate is not just going to strip trans 
youth of their rights, it will end up hurting everyone.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>Trans kids deserve our respect, and our protection. If we as a 
society cannot figure out how to not be threatened by what we don’t 
understand, all will be lost. Kids who are exploring their identity with
 regards to sexuality and gender are not a threat to anyone. The 
Republican Party is continuing to use fear and ignorance as a platform, 
and it is pitiful.</p>

<p>These rules are known to create hostile environments for children. 
All throughout my years as a student in Virginia, queer and trans kids 
were already having a tough enough time. You should be supporting kids 
during this vulnerable period of their life instead of pushing unproven 
and prejudiced rules on them. Facts support gender affirmation for kids 
at this age and these transphobic policies will just harm the most 
vulnerable in your schools. These children are not dumb. Students and 
families follow the news and they will remember the harm you caused 
them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clearly, this administration is strongly opposed to suicide 
prevention among the young students who are trans or LGBTQ+.&nbsp; I 
just don't understand the cruelty in removing inclusive policies at each
 and every school in Virginia.&nbsp; Therefore, I am STRONGLY OPPOSED</p>

<p>There are many reasons why I oppose this policy as written, but I will keep it simple and stick to explaining just one:</p>
<p>The school years are some of the most important years of a young 
person's life in determining their own identity. The name a person 
chooses to use is a vital shorthand for expressing who they are and who 
they want to be. Not allowing young people to make this decision for 
themselves is dehumanizing. Additionally, this policy is not well 
thought out, as it also technically forbids obvious nicknames without 
explicit parental consent ("I prefer to be called Steph, not 
Stephanie"), which is a stance I cannot imagine a single person 
supports. This policy is hurtful not only to trans students but also to 
anyone who feels uncomfortable with their assigned name and wishes to be
 called something else (see all the people who have recently been 
uncomfortable with the name of "Karen"). Enforcing this is a waste of 
resources that will not help students and will, in fact, harm them 
instead.</p>

<p>Not only are these policies illegal but they will harm trans kids who
 are just trying to live their lives as who they are. This policy quite 
bluntly will kill trans kids because they won’t get the support they 
need at home they won’t get the support they need at school they’ll be 
kicked out on the streets and worse they will become depressed and 
suicidal. This is a terrible policy putting Virginia at the back and 
years and years of progress in this country.</p>

<p>This guidance is despicable. It threatens transgender students and 
leaves them open to bullying, ostracizing, and prone to depression and 
suicide. The current DOE policy is Virgina law and should not be 
overturned by the governor's misguided policy.</p>

<p>Youngkin dresses up his fascist Christian ideology taking precedent 
in schools as parental rights—but what of the rights of children? 
Youngkin thinks no child should be able to confide in a guidance 
counselor or teacher if they are trans without the school informing the 
parents immediately. Would you do this if a child said they were being 
abused at home? If they don’t feel safe with their parents? “Parental 
rights” my ass, you want to strip away the dignity and agency of 
children. How does providing trans kids w a safe space violate anybody 
else’s 14th amendment rights?! What a sick joke.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ALL kids should feel safe at school. Trans kids already deal with

<p>This policy is created with the intention of harming trans 
students.&nbsp; Outing them to their families can lead to abuse, and in 
dire circumstances, the suicide of the kid.&nbsp; The policy is designed
 with the intent of discouraging kids from trusting any adult.</p>

<p>Let’s start by noting that historically, trans youth have had an 
exponentially higher rate of suicide. One thing that psychologists have 
noticed is that there’s less gender dysphoria when trans people feel 
supported and protected. That means that the suicide rate goes down for 
the most vulnerable segment of the population when they are made to feel
 like part of the population.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>Now, let’s think about numbers. There have been exactly zero cases of
 children sexually assaulting other children in restrooms solely by 
claiming trans status. There was one case of a potential romantic 
partner pressure situation (not sure if it was charged as an assault), 
which could happen with any same-gender couple, just as it does for 
mixed-gender couples. And that has nothing to do with the person’s 
gender identity. So the DOE’s prior change in position supporting trans 
youth did nothing harmful, and helped create safer spaces for trans 
youth.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>Now, the administration wants to use trans youth as a punching bag to
 rally a base that is out-of-touch with current medical and 
psychological recommendations. This is abhorrent. The DOE should not use
 a vulnerable class to try to make political gains for the governor. 
This is not political theater; actual lives are on the line - and not 
just by suicide. Youth being raised in bigoted households will see this 
and think it’s okay to bully trans people, who already have one of the 
highest rates for victimization when it comes to assault and murder, 
with trans people of color being at the greatest risk. By allowing the 
governor to go through with this, it will put trans youth at risk for 
violence of all types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I urge you to scrap this proposed policy.</p>

<p>I disagree that the 2021 Model Policies promoted as the specific 
viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in 
schools, the point of the 2021 policy was to protect some of our most 
vulnerable students with policies grounded in the latest medical and 
evidence based research regarding this relatively small population of 
children.&nbsp; Nothing in the policy as it currently exists prevents 
parents from parenting from parenting their children how they see fit. 
It is unfortunate that a small vocal group is using this policy as a 
political weapon to rile up people who are otherwise kind hearted and 
want nothing more than to protect their children. Don't think that the 
voters don't see what is going on here.</p>

<p>Transgender children harm no one by the act of being transgender. The
 United States government, more specifically the government of Virginia,
 has an obligation to protect the citizens residing in it - regardless 
of gender, race, sexuality, or monetary status. Support as an American 
citizen, especially in an educational institution, should not be 
conditional. Protect transgender children in school settings.</p>

<p>As the mother of an adult Trans daughter, I strongly oppose Governor 
Youngkin's proposed policy. There is absolutely NO reason to make life 
even more difficult for young people who are already marginalized, 
picked on, misunderstood and villified. I am grateful that my daughter 
had supportive teachers in school who helped her get through her teenage
 years that were extraordinarily difficult. She trusted one teacher, in 
particular, who was not required to speak to me. I am grateful she had 
that option, since being Trans involves a great deal of fear: that you 
will not be accepted, that you will not be loved, that you will not be 
physically safe, that society will treat you as deviant...exactly what 
this proposed legislation does. Trans kids are deserving as any child of
 acceptance, love and safety, and this proposed legislation strips them 
of those things in their schools and potentially in their homes. These 
kids are not hurting anyone. They just want to live their lives, be 
treated with dignity, and be left alone instead of targeted by people 
who make them the focus of unfounded fears. Many of them are just 
struggling to get through each day and the danger for them of self-harm 
and even suicide is much higher than average. Can't we support them 
instead of adding to their burden?</p>

<p>There ought to be no discrimination at school from educators or other

they belong to their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The governor's latest transgender policies are bigoted and appalling,
 but the worst part is that it takes away my local districts ability to 
do what's best for it's students and families. Why does Richmond care 
what individual transgender policies our schools enact?&nbsp; 
Republicans only care about taking away rights, not protecting their 
constituents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m a grandparent. I also work with refugee families. &nbsp;The 
&nbsp;policy is cruel because it increases the risk of homelessness for 
transgender kids. Kids know if their parents will be supportive and 
accepting. What they desire most is family support so if they have not 
told their parents it’s because they know the risks. Not having family 
support or school support to be themselves increases their &nbsp;risk of
 suicide. <br>this police hopes to erase trans and nonbinary kids from 
schools; the policy creates hatred and &nbsp;danger, not belonging. 
Punishes or prohibits teachers and counselors from supporting students 
who need their support. All marginalized students deserve respect and 
inclusion, including transgender and non-binary students.&nbsp;<br>I 
oppose the draft policy and ask VDOE to reject this cruel hateful 
policy. &nbsp;It benefits no one to be cruel, hateful, and dismissive 
and disrespectful of anyone else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re not gonna pretend like there aren’t abusive parents in the 
state of Virginia—let’s start there first. You really think if some of 
these parents find out about a child’s identity that their rage is 
somehow going to just be channeled into some wholesome discourse with 
their children about how they identify at school in a safer environment 
than at home?</p>
<p>Do the math, why do you think kids would hide this information from 
parents????? The state of Virginia can see why kids hide who they are 
from family at home but you wanna keep a record and report on these 
babies for just trying to figure out they’re human?</p>
<p>Think about how much being trans and a child in America is hotly 
debated right now, think about the fact that many of these kids aren’t 
even safe at home to begin with. Not everyone is blessed with loving, 
forgiving, compassionate parents who will work with their kid through 
anything. Y’all know damn well that’s not been everyone’s blessing.</p>
<p>So you wanna put children, literal kids, in a position where any 
parent who could harm them is made aware of who they are in a safer 
environment like at school? Google the rates of homelessness in LGBTQ 
teens.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>when my father found out about me I was locked in my room for days. 
Beaten. It didn’t take the transness out of me but it almost killed me. 
And it only got worse.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>spend this time trying to build compassionate communities who don’t 
judge or react in violence or exclusion because someone else is 
experiencing a different life. If that’s too hard a task, step the <img src="VirginiaRegulatoryTownHallViewComments1_files/blackbox.gif" alt="black box" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: middle">
 down from office because you don’t belong in leadership if listening to
 marginalized communities and assessing risk fairly is not part of your 
skill sets.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>protect trans kids.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Totally OPPOSE the withdrawal of the 2021 Model guidelines for the 
Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia Public Schools as it 
VIOLATE the Virginia Values Act, which itself amends the Virginia Human 
Rights act to include specifically enacted PROTECTIONS for all 
Virginians - students, parents and teachers alike, from discriminatory 
actions based on <em><strong>sex, sexual orientation or gender identity.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is nothing in the 2021 guidelines that precludes parents' 
involvement in their child's education, progress, participation. Parents
 are of course free to openly discuss their child's thoughts and 
feelings on all issues related to sex, sexual orientation and gender 
identity according to their beliefs, mores and cultural identity.&nbsp; 
But school policy should NOT be used to violate a student - or teacher 
or other staff member - to treat ANY student (a "person")&nbsp; 
differently based on their identity.&nbsp; The Code of Virginia 
currently states: <em>It is an </em><strong>unlawful </strong><em>discriminatory practice for any <strong>person</strong>,
 including the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent, 
agent, or employee of any place of public accommodation, to refuse, 
withhold from, or deny any individual, or to attempt to refuse, withhold
 from, or </em><strong>deny any individual, directly or indirectly</strong><em>,
 any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, services, or 
privileges made available in any place of public accommodation, </em><strong>or</strong><em> to segregate or discriminate against any such person in the use thereof, </em><strong>or</strong><em> t</em><strong>o
 publish, circulate, issue, display, post, or mail, either directly or 
indirectly, any communication, notice, or advertisement to the effect 
that any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or 
services of any such place shall be refused, withheld from</strong><em>, or denied to any individual on the basis of r</em>ace, color, religion, national origin, <strong>sex</strong>, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, age, <strong>sexual orientation, gender identity,</strong> marital status, disability, or status as a veteran.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2021 policy supports the provisions of the Virginia 
Antidiscrimination law. To withdraw that support and propose contrary 
guidance for the treatment of Transgender (or other sexual minorities) 
in the public school system is UNLAWFUL.</p>
<p>Parents are FREE and I support the wish for them to engage with and 
to discuss with their children anything they wish - included such things
 related to sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other 
subject of concern to them with relation to their children. It is 
PARENTS job to provide a safe and unthreatening channel of of 
communication with their own children.&nbsp; If parents' do not wish to 
participate in the free and open, supportive environment in public 
schools based on their own individual set of beliefs, religious, moral 
or otherwise, they are free to educate their children at home, or in 
private schools.&nbsp; PUBLIC accomodation is mandated to be free of any
 form of discrimination.</p>

<p>Governor Youngkin's anti-trans policies are in violation of the 
Virginia Human Rights Act, as it specifically bans discrimination on the
 basis of sex and gender identity. Requiring school districts to uphold 
these policies is a waste of time that could be better spent on 
supporting all Virginia students. Transphobia is both harmful and 
unproductive, and these policies are cruel and useless.</p>

<p>Coming from an assigned at birth female, high school class of 2024 student, I strongly <strong>oppose</strong>
 this legislation. This law puts transgender students at higher risk of 
suicide attempts and thoughts. The only people who feel threatened by 
trans people using the bathroom of their preferred gender are 
transphobic adults, most of which don’t even work in a school. NOT any 
of us students. Teachers and students don’t even use the same restrooms.
 This law isn’t to make students feel safer- if it was, our voices would
 be factored in. It’s just discrimination. Shame on everyone who let 
this happen.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the Governor's anti-trans policy for Virginia 
Department of Education. This plan, if enacted, would result in further 
alienation of trans students in our schools, resulting in a significant 
impact to their ability to feel comfortable in their educational 
environment. This will have a negative impact on their abilities for 
academic success, social development, and impact their general 
livelihoods. Students spend a significant amount of their lives in 
school, and to be placed in an environment where the Governor has 
mandated a hostile environment against them can only do harm, and not 
any good, and in extreme cases, can result in suicide in a population 
that is already at higher risks for suicide.</p>
<p>While we may have different opinions about human sexuality, it should
 never be viewed by anyone as acceptable for students to be "outed" 
against their will to their parents. These proposed regulations would do
 just that, potentially expanding the harm for LGBTQ+ students not only 
to their school environment, but also their home environment. In serious
 cases, this may even result in the student being made homeless by their
 families, and youth LGBTQ+ homelessness is well documented.</p>
<p>Forcing trans students to use bathrooms that do not correspond with 
their true gender identity makes these students targets for bullying, 
abuse, and violence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These regulations also clearly violate the Virginia Values Act and 
are therefore unlawful. If the Governor wishes to pursue this harmful 
policy, he must go through the Legislature to change the law. This is, 
quite simply, unlawful executive overreach by the part of the Governor.</p>
<p>I respect that many different people of goodwill can have differing 
opinions on LGBTQ+ rights in our schools, but we should ALL be able to 
agree that what should unite us is a desire to help all of our students 
and create good environments for them to learn. We can not do that if we
 make LGBTQ+ students out to be "the enemy" in pursuit of a culture-war 
agenda.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the Governor will reconsider this short-sighted policy, and 
when he does not, I know our Courts will do the right thing and strike 
down these unlawful regulations that will harm our kids and students. We
 will not tolerate this executive overreach that uses kids as pawns in 
one man's Presidential ambitions.</p>

<p>Even with the most supportive of parents, figuring out you’re trans 
is absolutely terrifying, and it’s something that can’t be rushed. Teens
 need the ability to go about discovering themsleves, and coming to 
understand their own gender, at a pace that allows them to feel safe; 
this includes giving them the control over who knows what they’re 
struggling with (and who knows they’re trans). Beyond this, creating an 
environment where students cannot confide in school counselors the 
things they can’t get trust their parents with will cause them to turn 
in on themselves; as it is, trans youth have extremely high rates of 
depression and suicide, largely in part because they cannot safely be 
themselves.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>furthermore, not every parent is accepting. The response ranges, 
generallly, from “polite but confused acceptance” to “you’re here, but 
we don’t accept you and will make your life a living hell every time you
 don’t conform to what we want” to “I will kick you out of the house for
 existing as a trans person.” Depending on which type of parents the 
child has to report to, mandatory reporting of gender identity to said 
parents could actually result in an extremely depressed child— and 
that’s the better case scenario. The worst is homelessness, homicide 
(trans people, especially trans women, are massive hate crime targets) 
and/or suicidality.&nbsp;<br><br>Younkin is not trans. He will never 
understand what it is like to feel disconnected from yourself; to know 
that in order to be who you are, you have risk your life and your 
livelihood. This risk doesn’t end upon leaving public school, but it can
 be mitigated if we just give our trans youth the right to 
self-determination when it comes to what their parents do or don’t know.
 Because parents aren’t some distant connection to meet up with on 
holidays, to the underaged: they’re landlords, they’re lawmakers, 
they’re in complete and utter control of every aspect of your life to 
the point where gaining your own freedom— and your own legal autonomy-/ 
&nbsp;before eighteen has to be won in a /court case/ (emancipation) if 
you’re willing to strive for it at all. There is no escaping them when 
you share your house with them, and are dependent on them in every sense
 of the term. Maybe Youngkin has forgotten that, as old as he is, but 
that is what it is for these children— for all children, even in the 
best of circumstances. </p>
<p>Let them still have this one freedom. Let them know that, if nothing 
else, their schools can be the sanctuaries they were built to be.</p>

<p>We are not a theocracy. Our constitution specifically calls for the 
separation of church and state. To impose the hateful religious beliefs 
of a small minded, backwards and vocal minority on students in Virginia 
is antithetical to what this country was founded on. Your restriction of
 the rights and freedoms of transgender individuals is anti American and
 immoral.</p>

<p>Nothing in it impairs the safety of any student whether gay or those 
with gender dysphoria. It doesn't inhibit teachers and administrators 
from protecting students.&nbsp; It also protects girls safety and 
privacy.&nbsp; The right of all students to act and speak in conformance
 with reality is protected without denying them choice to act and speak 
with grace - just as it should be.</p>

<p>I am opposed to the new guidelines, as they do not fulfill the spirit
 or letter of the requirements laid out under state law 22.1-23.3.<br><br>Namely, (emphasis mine):<br>... that address common issues regarding transgender students <em>in accordance with evidence-based best practices</em> and include information, guidance, procedures, and standards relating to:</p>
<p>1. Compliance with applicable nondiscrimination laws;</p>
<p>2. Maintenance of a safe and supportive learning environment free from discrimination and harassment for all students;</p>
<p>3. Prevention of and response to bullying and harassment;<br>...<br><br>These
 new guidelines are not consistent with evidence-based best practices, 
violate nondiscrimination precedent (e.g. the Equal Protection Clause 
and Title IX, per <em>Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board</em>), are
 not consistent with a discrimination-free and safe and supportive 
learning environment, and actively encourage situations that will lead 
to ostracization and bullying/harassment.<br><br>Therefore I am strongly opposed to these new guidelines and urge the DoE to reconsider them.</p>

<p>Please stop playing politics with real people's lives!</p>
<p>You don't have to understand why someone is trans in order to respect them.</p>
<p>Denying an individual's identity and wishes affects them in negative ways.</p>
<p>Trans kids are at the highest risk for mental health issues and 
suicide - because of not being accepted by their friends and family.</p>
<p>WE MUST PROTECT TRANS PEOPLE!</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this cruel and uninformed policy. It attempts to 
overturn state law and a US Supreme Court ruling and so is no doubt 
illegal. Why would state officials seek to make life more difficult for 
transgender and other gender nonconforming students? It makes no sense 
and helps no one. Allow parents and students to work with their schools 
to determine what is right for them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This decision to deny the existence of some Virginia students will 
have terrible ramifications for the state. Even excluding the severe 
mental and physical health damages this will cause on at-risk teens, 
this will also cripple virginia's economy right as we dive into a 
terrible recession. I previously lived in North Carolina and left after 
the debacle over the transphobic bathroom bill that cost the state 
billions of dollars in lost investment because the state was seen as 
unfriendly to business. Do we think those same business leaders will 
want to move or expand their headquarters here knowing their employees' 
children won't be safe from state-sanctioned discrimination? I already 
recognize the administration of this governor does not respect the will 
of the majority of voters or the danger this demagoguery risks, but 
hopefully at least this administration will care about the economic 
hazards a choice like this brings to our state.</p>

<p>Simply stated: Model 2022 quoting from document and Gov Youngkin: 
that School personnel will refer to students using pronouns which are 
appropriate for the biological sex appearing on their school record, any
 changes must be legally documented and provided to School division. 
Boys and girls use the boys and girls bathroom. Most importantly&nbsp;</p>
<p>PARENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE ANY and ALL DECISIONS with respect to 
their children. and are the primary arbiters and caretakers for their 
children..&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you so much Governor Youngkin, LG Sears and Attorney General 
Miyares for protecting parents and protecting all children from 
extremism at school—for ensuring that it would be a safe place for 
students and for parents to send their children without fear that they 
will be invited to hide secrets or act in a way that violates the 
culture of their home and family. Thank you for respecting the state and
 US Constitution—no doubt part of the reason why you were elected! 
&nbsp;Keep up the essential and important work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am very much against Governor Youngkin's proposed educational 
guidelines. Despite Youngkin's claims, I feel that they are (with 
malicious intent) discriminatory towards transgender youth and exposes 
them to danger from potentially abusive parental authority. As someone 
with transgender loved ones, this is an issue I feel very strongly 
about, hence my vigorous opposition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You cannot claim to care for students’ well-being whilst supporting 
such legislation. This will do nothing but harm both transgender 
students and those who stand alongside them as they navigate their 
already tumultuous journey to find themselves and acceptance.</p>

<p>Youngkin's policy of outing trans students, banning them from the 
bathrooms that they choose, and not allowing them to use the pronouns 
they choose, flies in the face of the freedom that this country was 
supposed to be founded upon. It's disgusting and should be ended.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This bill will do more harm than any good. Trans students deserve 
protection at the highest form, especially due to the high number of 
self harm rates. (And especially amongst POC families). Many students 
look to schools as a place of acceptance and love, and to have that 
place be another form of hinderance in their growth would cause more 
harm. Many families, while good-intentioned, do not make the best 
decisions for their child at first glance and in turn create more harm, 
thus making our new generation a lot more fragile and/or rough around 
the edges to new things like learning. We owe it to them to be open and 
accepting to listen to them. Parents are very much allowed to have a say
 however they should not be the ones controlling the schools, and thus 
if they do not like what the school is doing, they have the right to 
move schools. The Parents should not hold such power over a place where 
many children view it as a safe haven and a place to learn and be 
accepted by their peers as they grow into themselves. No harm has come 
of children being children.</p>

<p>My bishop’s wife saw me hold hands with a girl at a high school 
football game. She spread the word “out of concern” and outed me when I 
wasn’t ready to tell my parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my dad found out I was gay and he beat the <img src="VirginiaRegulatoryTownHallViewComments1_files/blackbox.gif" alt="black box" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: middle"> out of me for it for years after that.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>there was no help for me at home and there will be nothing but hurt 
if a child has to be reported to potentially dangerous home environments
 that could increase risk of suicide, murder, rape, and other abuse. If

you sit.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>This bill is a wolf disguised in grandma's clothing. Parading this as
 an avocation for parents rights is a farce and down right insulting. 
Teenage depression, anxiety, and suicide rates are already at an all 
time high. Outing, targeting, and maliciously invalidating these 
children's rights is DISGUSTING. It is clear that the students DO NOT 
support these changes, nor are they the ones bothered by the current 
legislation. Since the students are the ones being directly affected by 
this, I stand with them. I stand for the PROTECTION of our children, 
transgender children included. This bill is directly targeting a 
minority group based on sexual identity, which is protected under our 
constitution. This bill will bring nothing but more suicides, and will 
HURT these children. Young Youngkin needs to keep his religious views 
out of our schools.</p>

<p>This proposal will limit the ability of children to safely develop 
their identity in a free and fair school environment. It will also serve
 to damage the mental health of transgender children that prefer names 
that differ from their name at birth.</p>

<p>I oppose Governor Youngkin's proposed policy on transgender and 
nonbinary youth. I am a transgender citizen of the Commonwealth of 
Virginia and have seen the harm that hate and discrimination against 
marginalized members of society face. The governor's proposal can only 
serve to further erode the support and the protection Virginia's trans 
youth need to survive, thrive and be valued for who they are.</p>

<p>If we want to have a functioning society we need to allow people to 
be their best selves so that they can be productive members of the 
community. It is not healthy or productive to allow someone other than 
yourself to decide who you can be. It is unconscionable to think that we
 are still trying to justify allowing someone to be "other" than what we
 are used to in order to be acceptable as humans. I truly hope that we 
do not put these kids through more stress and harm simply because people
 don't understand their choices. The idea that trans kids are a danger

and we regularly allow them to be hurt by themselves and others while we
 debate whether or not it's ok for them to go to the bathroom and be 
left alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parents have a right to be involved with any decision or issue 
related to their children.&nbsp; School systems are not the parents and 
should get back to teaching academics. Counselors should not hide behind
 closed doors pushing confused kids into making declarations. </p>

<p>These are dangerous and discriminatory measures that will perpetuate 
transphobia and hate. Kids will live in fear and die if the state of 
Virginia moves forward with implementing these policies.</p>

<p>Myself and many, many others are strongly opposed to this proposal, and this policy <em>will</em>
 kill people. Keep LGBTQ+ strudents safe in Virginia, and wholeheartedly
 reject this notion, and all like it. There is absolutely no reason why a
 policy like this should exist in the first place, and it helps 
absolutely no one. In fact, the cruelty of this proposal is probably the
 point, and those who are pushing this agenda should be strongly 
condemned for using their position of power to enact unjust and 
discriminatory policies for no other reason than to enforce their belief
 system on folks who don't share it.</p>

<p>I strongly suspect this does NOT align with the majority‘s beliefs in the state.</p>
<p>why don’t you just move on from Virginia and go ahead and spend your

<p>Virginia is not going back. We will not harm children for the 
Governor to engage in a political demonstration of intolerance to curry 
favor with extremist bigots so he can run for President.<br><br>We won't
 harm children by subjecting them to intolerance in an attempt to apply a
 contorted religious standard to children in a public school system.<br><br>We
 won't reject the gender identity of anyone in public schools. We won't 
fear monger or introduce onerous legal obstacles to acknowledging and 
respecting the names and gender identities of anyone associated with 
public school in Virginia.</p>
<p>We won't put one life at risk by enacting these hateful policies. 
Virginia law protects Virginians from abuses of human rights and these 
policies do not supersede the law.</p>
<p>As a parent, Virginia is not acting in my interest or protecting my 
rights in any way with policies of hate and intolerance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nazis are very cool with treating trans people like <img src="VirginiaRegulatoryTownHallViewComments1_files/blackbox.gif" alt="black box" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: middle">.
 Did you know they also had similar reporting systems for queer people? 
Why do you think anti-trans rallies often have Nazi flags with swastikas
 being waved?</p>
<p>Maybe coincidence.</p>

<p>This is a blatant attack on children, and the opening salvo in the

<p>Adding this additional layer of requirement to have a trans kids 
pronouns and any name change requests honored by teachers will not keep 
them any safer or healthier. Trans kids are not always growing up in a 
safe, supportive home. They need to be given the space to safely express
 their gender. Asking to use a different name harms no one. Asking for 
something as minimal as saying "She" instead of "He" harms no one. 
Notifying a parent who does not support their child's wishes harms that 
child. We need to have places children can feel safe when their home is 
not one of those places. They need refuge. They need social support. 
Forcing all requests to come from a parent isolates that child. They 
will wither. We need to allow children a degree of autonomy and the 
space to develop a sense of self determination. Children are not empty 
robots to be piloted by their parents until they are an adult. They are 
thinking, feeling people. And they may hold values and beliefs counter 
to their parents. That does NOT make them harmful. That does NOT make 
them a concern a parent must be notified about. Allow children to become
 their own people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I join with many Virginia families, leaders and citizens who advocate
 instead for enlightened, fair-minded and inclusive policies that keep 
public schools safe for all students - including gender non-conforming 
and transgender individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I therefore oppose the cruel, rigid, harmful and ill-founded changes 
advocated by this Administration that will discriminate against trans 
people and all of our families who are dedicated to individual freedom 
and acceptance. We fear these discriminatory changes also will be 
short-lived, if adopted, since it is more than likely they will fly in 
the face of the Constitutional protections articulated by the Supreme 
Court in the Bostock case in 2020.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a mental health therapist and compliant with our guiding ethics, I
 strong oppose this guidance document. All children should be protected 
in schools, including transgender children and adolescents. 
Pediatricians, psychologists, and counselors know how to treat these 
concerns and we resoundingly oppose any policy that is not affirming to 
gender identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To include the words "dignity" and "respect" in a proposal that so 
viciously and pointedly denies both to trans students is cruel and 
disingenuous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no legitimate reason to deny a student being called by a 
preferred name and using the pronoun that suits them best.&nbsp; 
Additionally, there is no reason to require parental approval to use 
those names and pronouns either; giving someone basic respect and 
treating them with dignity does not involve permission from someone 
else. If you have a student who wishes to be called by their middle name
 rather than their legal first name, do you require parental approval 
for that? Put differently - what is your actual issue here?</p>
<p>To deny a child their lived identity (or to require a 
parent/guardian's permission for a child to be themselves) is cruelty 
for the sake of cruelty. It protects no one and instead harms a very 
specific portion of the population.</p>
<p>Virginia is better than this, and our top-notch public schools should
 be a reflection of the fact that we believe in the inherent worth and 
value of all of our children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A person’s gender identity is personal and for them to disclose of 
they so choose. The same people trying to pass this are those who claim 
that a fetus in the womb should be treated with human rights but can’t 
even give living humans basic rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would encourage every person supporting our governor to do two 
things: &nbsp;First, read and understand the facts provided by medical 
professionals on this topic. &nbsp;Every single major/accredited medical
 group opposes these types of restrictions. &nbsp;If the research seems 
overwhelming, do one simple thing, contact and ask your local 
pediatrician for their thoughts; they will help you understand why this 
is life-threatening and critical to the well-being of those affected. 
&nbsp;Second, reach out to a trans person....ask them why it is 
important that these youth be allowed the simple action of being 
affirmed in school; hear their story...</p>
<p>Please, do not take action in support out of ignorance, fear or hate....lives depend on this, truly.</p>

<p>Gender identity is a political theory, not a scientific one. It has 
become a matter of much hysteria. Juveniles are not fully formed as 
people; schools can assist with socialization and education but cannot 
replace the parents. I applaud the governor's policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We pulled both of our teen boys out of FCPS for a myriad of reasons, 
and the way the public school system in this country is becoming more 
like a prison system is alarming. Your gender has NOTHING to do with 
your education, employment etc. Trying to make the less than 1% of 
nontrans kids feel like they are being forced to accommodate others’ 
gender dysphoria is ridiculous. It does not belong in school or the work
 place. Period. Focus on education, not being woke to accommodate bad 
parenting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this proposal. It will harm students and prevent 
them from being able to safely develop their identity in a supportive 
school environment. It will also damage the mental health of transgender
 children and put them at greater risk of harming themselves.</p>

<p>I have been an educator for 13 years and a mother for over 25 years. 
The one thing I know for sure about kids is that they deserve acceptance
 and safety to be healthy mentally and physically. Kids, just like 
adults, deserve FREEDOM to be who they are, love who they love, and to 
express themselves - regardless of their gender identity.</p>
<p>These rules will force kids to lose their freedom. Their right to 
life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness will be dashed in one fell 
swoop. This doesn't just affect trans kids, it affects everyone. If we 
are to be a place for freedom and justice for all, then everyone 
deserves to live the way they want, and to be who they are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Government should stay out of personal lives and let kids live in
 their full, beautiful, and empowered selves. We should love and support
 trans kids, or at the very least, leave them alone to be 
themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please rescind the proposed revised policy for the treatment of 
transgender students in public schools.&nbsp; Let people live the lives 
they choose. They do no harm to anyone and these policies are 
discriminatory and harassing behavior from the government. We elect 
officials to include all and be empathetic to all constituents not to 
divide and be hateful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am in full support of these model policies as they protect students
 and require open dialogue with parents and full transparency on the 
part of school districts. The former model policies were divisive and 
minimized/overlooked parental input and involvement. These model 
policies are what is best for Virginia students.</p>

<p>I am the parent of a high school student and a recent graduate from 
Virginia's public schools. My (cis) kids have had no issues with their 
trans/nonbinary classmates and are completely accepting of them for who 
they are. Why should they care or be bothered by this? I don't 
understand this at all.&nbsp; To tell teachers that they cannot treat 
their students with respect for who they are (by using their preferred 
names) is beyond cruel and will lead to increased bullying and has zero 
to do with "parental rights".&nbsp; Can a kid be asked to be called by 
their middle name or a nickname? Who cares!? Do parents routinely get 
asked if their kid wants to be called by a nickname? What if they want 
to be called by a middle name that is gender non-specific ? Or a made-up
 / self selected name? Who CARES!? How does this violate someone's 
"convictions"? Please stop this nonsense and work to increase acceptance
 of kids who are already struggling against a society that often wants 
to pretend they don't exist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transgender youth are already vulnerable to harassment and 
discrimination. This policy would only single out transgender students 
and increase the harm that comes to them. Let kids be kids, and let 
schools be a safe haven for ALL students. This policy would endanger 
students who simply want to be themselves.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose Glenn Youngkin's cruel and dangerous "model 
policies" that target transgender youth. Among other things, the 
policies would allow and in some cases require misgendering of trans 
students; would out vulnerable trans children; would ban students from 
using the bathroom consistent with their gender identity, and 
more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose Younkin’s proposal. This legislation will 
negatively impact the lives and futures of LGBTQ+ children for 
generations to come. Psychological evaluation has proven that not 
affirming the gender of young transgender children leads to increased 
mental health crises and suicides.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>School Enables Children to Grow Into Adults</strong>

<p>Most adults have antedotes on how a teacher or other faculty member 
made a difference in their lives by allowing them space to develop and 
grow into the person they are. Taking away teachers ability to use 
discretion and adjust their methods will result in loss of this 
mentorship opportunity for one of the most vulnerable groups at this 
age. Giving students a safe place to learn free from bias and threat of 
outing will improve the chances that young people reach adulthood (see 
LGBT suicide rates) as well as grow into successful adults. There's no 
gain from this change.</p>

<p>Thank you for making parental rights a priority and eliminating 
school policies that endanger children. &nbsp;Thank you for your 
unwavering commitment to ensuring that the focus of our schools is on 
academic excellence rather than the sexualization and manipulation of 
our youth. Thank you for not ignoring facts and believing in science and
 biology. Please do not let lobbyist groups and activists dictate what 
happens in our schools. Children need facts not opinions and they need 
their parents to be their moral compass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an ideal world, kids will feel free to share their gender 
questioning with their parents. We don't live in that world - in ours, a
 leading cause of teenage homelessness is expulsion after revealing 
lgbtq status to a parent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our schools need to be havens for kids, including respecting their 
gender identity and privacy.&nbsp; This policy discriminates against 
trans kids.&nbsp;</p>

<p>this will kill trans students. parents r meant to help children grow 
and become adults not control every aspect od their life. Parents who 
don’t know their children are trans usually have a reason. if schools 
are required to out trans students they are putting trans students in 
danger. children will get KICKED OUT. “support children of virginia” 
unless they are trans right.</p>

<p>This is a harmful, mean policy that only serves to help one person, 
and that is Glenn Youngkin as he appeals to the Most fringe of right 
wingers.</p>
<p>Children should have the autonomy to chose what name they wish to go 
by, and explore their gender identity on their own terms. Some parents 
would do harm to their kids if they were forcibly outed, enough that it 
is not with passing a policy like this. If parents on the right are 
truly concerned they can talk to their children, instead of forcing 
teachers into the role of spy and nanny.</p>
<p>it’s also telling that, even when there is documentation in place, 
Gov Youngkin would include a section about not addressing the student by
 their proffered name/pronoun if it “infringes in your 1st amendment 
rights”; why would there be this section if the point of this is just 
parental rights like the VA GOP claims? This shows me this policy has 
nothing to do with caring about Trans children; it’s only about our 
Governor appealing to the cruelest sorts.</p>
<p>I strongly oppose this policy, it’s cruel and harmful and done not 
out of concern but an urge by the governor and others to harm children. 
It’s vile.</p>

<p>As a trans adult living in Virginia, I know that just growing up and 
coming to terms with being trans is hard enough. But, to be vilified 
while going through this process adds will traumatize kids. My family 
was supportive, but I know so many LGBTQ adults and children who were 
thrown out and ostracized, or worse, abused. We should trust that 
children know whether their home environment is safe.</p>

<p>Why is the State interfering in personal medical decisions and trying

<p>Listen to medical professionals and stop playing culture warrior to

<p>I have had my child in private school since kindergarten as I do not 
trust the public school system with my child’s moral formation. Up to 
this point a public school system is not a good steward of my child’s 
innocence or my child’s education. Under this new leader ship I have 
hope for a more common sense approach to education and I have a small 
glimmer of hope for the future.</p>

<p>As a transgender person, and a former FCPS student, I believe it is 
VERY important to allow transgender students to be comfortable and safe 
learning. "Parents' rights" do NOT include choosing your childs 
gender/sexuality, and attempting to do so is ABUSE. I went to FCPS for 
years, school wasn't safe for me growing up, but it was safer than home,
 and it's cruel to take that away from kids.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy supports outing trans children to their parents, which in
 turn can cause them to be kicked out and cause more teen homelessness.

<p>As a life-long resident, I feel strongly that this legislation pulls 
us backwards for no benefit. Regardless of what we may accept or 
disapprove of in our personal lives, legislation like this that targets 
specific communities are anti-freedom and antithetical to the spirit of 
our great Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a state that has welcomed and provided community from 
everywhere in the world to become a place that is ethnically and 
culturally diverse and inclusive. We have become a springboard for 
innovative businesses, tech startups, and have attracted world-class 
businesses into the state. Reversing course and becoming less inclusive 
is exactly the wrong thing to do and will negatively impact our ability 
to attract innovation and investment.</p>
<p>For those out there who believe strongly that supporting diversity in
 gender identity is wrong, feel free to exercise your personal freedom 
to not identify as trans.</p>
<p>I 100% oppose the proposed policy. I vote, I pay taxes, and seeing 
Virginia continue in this direction would make me reconsider living and 
working here.</p>

<p>This policy is abhorrent and puts trans children’s lives at risk from
 hateful parents and others who hold bigoted and hateful 
attitudes.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>It must be opposed&nbsp;</p>

<p>trans children know who they are and must be supported, not outed to 
their parents who might be abusive or rejecting of their child’s 
identity</p>

<p>This policy is not only wrong legally, it is repugnant morally. Why 
target and remove protections for an extremely vulnerable group of 
Virginians? Why waste time and money on a policy that inflames both 
political bases but doesn’t serve the greater good? Youngkin’s one term 
can’t end soon enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am strongly opposed to Gov. Youngkin’s proposed changes regarding 
the “2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for all 
Students and Parents in Virginia’s Public Schools.” The irony of that 
title, when his policies will grant neither privacy, dignity nor respect
 to transgender students. I do not want my government having any 
involvement in people’s personal lives like this, the most personal 
aspects of identity and self-determination. This is not the role of 
government, and is a violation of the most basic of individual rights 
and freedoms. Do not enact this policy.</p>

<p>As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, who has worked with children 
and families for over 10 years, I strongly oppose the proposed policies 
regarding trans children and schools. We know from available research 
that LGBTQIA+ youth are already at increased risk of suicide and other 
mental health concerns. The proposed policies would further alienate 
these youth and add to the stigma around them that already exists. If 
this policy is implemented, we will see an increase in mental health 
symptoms and suicide among our children. Please prioritize the lives of 
our children!</p>

<p>It is policies like these that drive up the self-harm and suicide 
rates of children. Stop saying that you are doing this to "protect" 
children. Policies like this are bigoted in origin, they come from a 
fear of change and things that you dont understand. This is not what we 
the people of Virginia want for our children. Please dont do this.</p>

<p>Govern Youngkin needs to read the room again .. and again.&nbsp; This
 policy against transgendered kids is wrong and must be abandoned 
...Educators, the state, parents, neighbors, friends, all need to 
support transgendered kids&nbsp; -- not alienate them or their 
families.&nbsp; The policy in place works -- it is a good model for all 
of the states ... support all kids in school.&nbsp; Shame on the 
Governor and his team for trying to instill hate ... Do not implement 
this hateful, ignorant policy - and focus on what we now do with respect
 for LBGTQ and transgendered children&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks</p>

<p>I recently watched the 90-minute required parent/teen video 
instruction for my son to complete driver's ed.&nbsp; It is amazing to 
me how much that class emphasized the role of parents in influencing 
their teen's driving behavior and the role parents must take in 
establishing boundaries for creating safe drivers.&nbsp; The attitude in
 that class stood in stark contrast to the way parents are portrayed as 
useless and out of touch when it comes to something as important as 
gender identity!&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can't be both ways.&nbsp; Stick to what we know - parents matter!</p>

<p>I am a parent with two children in Virginia public schools. I’m very 
opposed to the proposed changes to transgender protections. These 
changes is just political grandstanding that will result in harm to 
transgender Virginians. The argument that this is “parents rights” but 
forgets that the students also have rights. Trans rights are human 
rights and this is just a politician punching down on a very vulnerable

<p>Rolling back the Virginian protections in place for trans students 
will push this state back years in policy and humanity. Kids will be 
pawns in a political game you are waging under the guise of a strategic 
moral panic. Trans kids deserve to feel safe at school. This will 
forcibly out students and endanger them to bullying, and social and 
familial strife. This will hurt kids and Republicans know that and they 
don’t care; they only care about cultivating votes over social 
scare-tactics because they know they cannot win on policy. Stop using 
Virginia’s kids as pawns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I believe that parents have a right to know about their child and 
what the child is going through. But I also know that some children's 
home life is not the safest. This means that in some homes, a parent or 
other family member may react in the form of abuse against the child. 
With that in mind, I do not believe it is the school's obligation or 
duty to notify parents in a child's decision. But a notification should 
be made if such a situation escalates to a mental health crisis that 
threatens the child's safety.</p>

<p>VA schools are obligated to protect all students-mentally, 
emotionally, and physically in loco parentis. That means protecting who 
they are without judgment. The governor’s proposal is unethical as well 
as illegal. Stop him NOW</p>

<p>Trans. Kids are very much aware of what they want and who they are. 
They are very mature and understand what is going on. Leave them alone 
to work out their lives with their families. Political input is not 
needed nor is it wanted.</p>

<p>By forcing their hands, this kind of law will only drive more kids 
further into "the closet" who do not feel safe opening up or sharing 
with adults, and hike up mental health issues, substance abuse, and 
suicides. This is a deeply flawed and put of touch approach to this 
subject and I'm truly APPALLED at the very notion of it. Just listen to 
all of the experts who have weighed in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your kids don't trust you enough to open up to you, consider where
 that fear is coming from. It's not on outsiders to force their hand, 
and allow them to be exposed to a potentially deeply unsafe 
environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I <em>strongly</em> oppose the hateful and dangerous proposed 
anti-trans school policies. The policies are rooted in transphobia and 
seek to further harm trans and nonbinary youth. They aim to erase trans 
and nonbinary youth from the classroom and create hostile &amp; 
potentially dangerous school environments. In the 2022 National Survey 
on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health, 45% of LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered 
attempting suicide in the past year and 14% of LGBTQ+ youth did attempt 
suicide in the past year. <em>LGBTQ+ youth who found their school to be LGBTQ+ affirming reported lower rates of attempting suicide.</em>
 These proposed policies deny the humanity of trans and nonbinary youth 
and will cause unnecessary violence and death. If these policies are not
 stopped from being established, the blood of all young LGBTQ+ lives who
 are harmed in Virginia will be on your hands, Youngkin.&nbsp;

<p>This bill is hateful. Children will die. Think of all the time and

<p>Glenn (Gwynithton) Youngkin cares more about getting his house 
classified to a farm for tax reasons than he cares about letting kids 
learn without being harassed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since he has no idea what a public school classroom is, nor does he 
understand what it is like to be a normal person, allow me to lay it out
 for you - being a child in public schools is hard enough. People will 
make fun of you for any reason they can. Therefore, allowing state 
sanctioned bullying is a bad idea. It shouldn't take 25,000 people 
calling you a <img src="VirginiaRegulatoryTownHallViewComments1_files/blackbox.gif" alt="black box" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: middle">wit for you to get the picture.</p>
<p>Stop using children to 'own the libs' you are literally hurting your 
cause and creating life long scars. Do us all a favor and go back to 
playing dress up as a governor. When you try to do anything, you just 
make it worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use your millions to make the world a better place. Your legacy is 
being etched on the walls of the wicked, and, sweetheart, it isn't 
sexy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I envy the folks who've never met you, Glenn.</p>

<p>These proposed regulations are a step backwards for Virginia 
transgender students, and will make those students less safe.&nbsp; You 
are repealing regulations based on respect and consideration and 
acceptance and replacing them with intolerance and outmoded ideas about 
gender and sexuality.&nbsp; People, including children, have the right 
to be who they truly are and our schools should be affirming and 
welcoming places.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is yet another case that is mind boggling as to why anyone even 
needs to reverse a nonsensical policy to begin with. I see all of these 
"opposed" remarks, yet, once more, like so much of the media, the 
screaming of a few doesn't represent the thoughts and values of the 
majority, hence why Youngkin got elected in the first place. Political 
agendas and societal brainwashing do not belong at school. While I am in
 support of people being who they truly believe they are and am 
certainly opposed to hateful acts from one group to the next, it should 
not trump or impede on the rights of parents and other children. 
Furthermore, this disturbing "trend" is adding confusion to kids who 
would not otherwise be confused. Research has suggested the brain is not
 fully developed until one's early 20s. Trans and especially "trans 
kids" are such an incredibly minuscule part of society, yet one would 
think, due to the noise of activists and other misguided individuals 
that this is commonplace. Adolescence is in itself almost a time of 
confusion, a time to naturally try on different hats if you will. This 
commonly means that the adolescent may switch tastes in clothes, want to
 be a rock star one day, then a few weeks later, a hippie and so on. 
Those changes or trying on of identities is perfectly normal during this
 stage of development. For the majority of kids and for the majority of 
time/history, this confusion has rarely ever meant they were confused on
 their true sex or gender.</p>
<p>It is preposterous and damaging to subject children to this during a 
very fragile state in their development.&nbsp; Even though trans and 
certainly this notion of "trans kids" are an extremely small part of the
 population, my only qualm about the new policies is that for those who 
truly and consistently over time believe they were born in the wrong 
skin, certain parents may not feel like a child's "safe place" to 
express their feelings, in which case I support them having another 
trusted adult, such as a counselor to confide in. All kids deserve a 
person they can share their deepest feelings and thoughts with. My 
support is mainly for the return of sanity and normalcy--for school to 
be a place that focuses on academics and promotes healthy social and 
psychological supports. This disturbing effort to desensitize children 
and/or the seemingly sexualization of children is incredibly scary and 
disturbing with respect to both physical and psychological safety. I'm 
not just talking about trans issues, but this overall sick push to 
normalize explicit and pornographic materials puts all of our children 
in jeopardy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I absolutely am vehemently opposed to biological boys being in girl's
 bathrooms, locker rooms or sports, nor should bio females be in boys' 
spaces. Having a single bathroom available for anyone to use seems 
reasonable. I also definitely don't support this pronoun nonsense no one
 really heard of until the past couple of years. I think Youngkin is 
trying to support common sense, righting wrongs of the extreme, and 
protecting parents' rights, but mostly children, especially our girls 
and daughters. Women have fought so hard for rights and to feel safe and
 respected. It is sad to see that take a step back lately. No one with a
 penis (short of a hermaphrodite) has any good idea of what it is like 
to be a woman physically, mentally, societally, and certainly should 
never be called, "mom." All kids and families have suffered so much by 
far-left policies and decision making from being kept from school to 
extreme political agendas. Pushing agendas on vulnerable children must 
stop! School should feel safe for all kids, but it is important to 
understand how all sides of this notion or idealism could create 
conflict for different sets of children. No one group will be completely
 happy. Supports for all should be in place without completely 
infringing on the rights of others. A guidance counselor stipulation 
where no names etc. are being changed might be ideal for ANY kids who 
may not have open and understanding parents whether this issue be one's 
sexuality, potential abuse, peer pressure, bullying, disability 
discrimination, racism etc. For any parents who disagree with that, 
there are guidance opt out forms. I also fully support, especially 
during adolescence where kids are leaning on peers more than parents at 
times, middle and high schools have trained peer support specialists 
where kids can talk to a supportive, non- judgmental peer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How will we, as a society, ever reach our goals of inclusion and

Teaching our children that our state thinks the thoughts and feelings 
which are inherent parts of their being are wrong is alienating and 
hateful.</p>

<p>When I moved from Virginia in 2021 as a 15 year old trans woman, I 
was happy. I felt safe and comfortable. I knew that my privacy would be 
protected, and I could confide safely with teachers about my identity. 
But I have watched this year from afar as my home, my Virginia, is 
slipping into fascism. I have watched as Glenn Youngkin, a man elected 
by only a 2% margin, has become a majoritarian and “culture war” 
vulture. I watched as he ignored the public school districts of Virginia
 and banned mask mandates. I watched as he created a fake narrative of 
“critical race theory” being taught in Virginia schools and egged on 
racist parents to “report” their school districts and teachers. And now I
 watch as he has turned his eye towards, like the rest of his fascist 
gubernatorial neighbors, towards us. Transgender youth in Virginia. 
Youngkin’s plan forces transgender children to be outed by schools to 
their parents, who may be abusive and extremely transphobic. Youngkin’s 
plan also forces schools to deadname and misgender children, which will 
crush their spirits even more than they already have been by the 
pressure of being transgender in America. <img src="VirginiaRegulatoryTownHallViewComments1_files/blackbox.gif" alt="black box" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: middle"> you Glenn Youngkin. Your policies will cause people to be killed, either by their own or someone else’s hand.</p>

<p>I shouldn't have to explain why this policy is cruel. Transgender 
students are and have always been free to come out to their parents 
personally, and many do—excluding those who have reason to suspect that 
their parents will not be loving and supportive. Mandating that schools 
disrespect and disregard students' chosen identities and even out those 
students to their parents (despite the very real possibility that those 
parents might react with abuse) is sick, and twisted, and serves no 
public interest.</p>
<p>But of course, the cruelty is by design. Governor Youngkin has chosen
 to sacrifice this tiny minority with no electoral power as red meat for
 his base. He is so dogmatically opposed to transgender identity that he
 has chosen to target children (who did not and could not vote for 
him)—and not just any children, but a vulnerable and oppressed minority 
of children. I only hope that Virginians recognize this cruelty for what
 it is and reject this government-sponsored persecution.</p>

<p>Children have basic human rights. Among those are to be treated with 
humanity and dignity, including when they are at school. The state has 
little opportunity to ensure these rights are being met within the home,
 but ample opportunity to ensure these rights are being met at school. 
Therefore schools should honor children's preferred names and pronouns 
while at school. Refusing to do so threatens the well-being of 
transgender and nonbinary students.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Glenn Youngkin is concerned about the safety of students, then 
mental health crises should be of greater concern. Treating transgender 
kids with respect and calling them by their chosen names harms no one. 
However, refusing to do so only seeks to further harm trans and 
non-binary kids. It creates a hostile and potentially dangerous school 
environment for those same students as they require teachers and staff 
to “forcibly out” students to their parents against the student’s will, 
even in cases where students seek counseling for abusive at home 
environments.</p>
<p>Mental health of students is a serious issue that is not focused on 
enough in our schools. LGBTQ+ children are higher risk of mental health 
crises. Youngkin's policy is putting trans students further into harm's 
way, it also forces the students into a bathroom and sports policy that 
do not adhere to their true gender identity, making them potential 
targets for bullying, abuse, and violence.</p>
<p>In 2021, Governor Ralph Northam signed the Virginia Values Act into 
law after it was passed through the General Assembly. This law 
sweepingly, effectively prohibited discrimination in public and private 
employment, credit, housing, and public accommodations on the basis of 
sexual orientation and gender identity, among other additional protected
 categories. The protections in this act have been extended to protect 
LGBTQ+ youth in Virginia public schools throughout the Commonwealth to 
prohibit discrimination, harassment, and violence in against these 
students. I have observed first hand the positive effects of this 
act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Glenn Youngkin is worried about privacy, dignity, and respect, 
then respect LGBTQ+ children and maintain their privacy (outing them to 
family is not respecting privacy).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Governor Youngkin’s proposals regarding transgender students, 
specifically regarding his insistence that they be referred to by their 
birth name rather than their chosen name and his demand that they not 
use facilities corresponding to their gender, are blatant attacks on the
 people of Virginia. Not only is it a brazen example of government 
overreach, but it is also an assault on Virginians’ rights to 
expression. For this reason, it must not pass.</p>

<p>Shame on you. I felt Va. was moving into the 21st century, then you 
got in.&nbsp; Did you address anything other than culture wars in 
schools. Nothing about energy, infrastructure, climate. Just the usual 
regressive program about keeping people out rather than letting people 
in.&nbsp; You are doing exactly what I thought you would do. The reason I
 did not vote for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Strongly and vehemently oppose. Outing children will put them at huge
 risk of abuse at home and amongst peers. Growing up in Georgia, much 
like Virginia, knowing that the risk of outing a child can cost them 
their life. Losing housing, abuse, bullying, this in turn can lead to at
 risk mental health and suicidal thoughts and behavior. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The proposed changes add an administrative Burden by not allowing 
teachers the freedom to address students by their preferred name and 
pronouns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Requiring a teacher to verify nicknames or preferred names with a 
database of parents wishes is an absurd management burden. Parents, 
obviously can assert their wishes officially but should not need to for 
routine matters of respect in a classroom. They can always raise a 
complaint if their are issues, but I suspect that will be rare unless a 
teacher is openly hostile to a child's wishes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, denying children this small level of agency in their 
lives seems cruel. Children already lack a lot of control over their 
lives and this small item (being able to choose what you call them) 
seems a very small concession to their autonomy.</p>

<p>This bill is cruel and rooted in bigotry. The unwillingness to change
 and callous disregard for our &nbsp;community will do nothing but hard.</p>
<p>For these reasons I strongly oppose Younkin’s policy to out transgender or gay children.</p>
<p>I strongly oppose the policy to force teachers, regardless of the 
wishes of the children or the parents of the children, to misgender 
children. This can be extremely damaging and harmful to a young 
child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>keep the church out of our government.</p>
<p>keep the hate out of our country.</p>
<p>keep people like Glen Younkin out of office.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>Parents have already shown their displeasure with the previous policy
 and the need for this new one to replace it by leaving school systems 
that have gone all in on these transgender agendas in large numbers. 
&nbsp;Returning student numbers a down in counties that have adopted 
policies that take power away from parents and encourage children to 
question their identities. The best thing VA can do is allow the dollars
 to follow the students.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am the parent of a trans child and this proposal is a direct threat
 to her physical and emotional health and safety. &nbsp;My daughter has 
every much right to exist as does any other child and her right to be 
who she is does not harm anyone. Quite the contrary: she is a gift from 
God and I am blessed every day to have her in my life. This proposal 
tells her she is not worthy of life and love and I am ashamed that the 
Commonwealth is even considering it. Her life matters and I will fight 
this proposal with everything I have in order to keep her alive.</p>

you need to use the boys room, the boys locker room and so on! If you 
have a vagina you need to use the girls room, the girls locker room, and
 so on! The school should not be hiding anything from the legal parent 
or guardian of any student! Those in education should stay in their lane
 and let the parents do the parenting!</p>

<p>Children deserve to have a safe space to grow and express themselves.
 Many kids do not have safe and supportive households. Schools can 
provide a safe place to these children. Be aware that should this pass, 
it will lead to abandonment, abuse, and suicide of children. Show 
compassion, not hatred to others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These attacked on the rights and privacy for non-binary students are 
just an extension of the ridiculous book banning culture wars that 
plague our state. These policies will lead to the deaths and reduction 
of mental health to many of our vulnerable students. Provide our schools
 with proper funding, support for all communities, and freedom to help 
those in need. Stop this regressive non-sense that we all know is simply
 a reason to attack public education, inflame a hateful voter base, and 
drive up division before mid-terms. The actions of the Governor resemble
 an impulsive child not a democratic leader. Anyone in support of this 
legislation should be ashamed.</p>

          <strong>VA Government Endangering Kids?</strong>
        </div>

<p>In regards to Virginia legislation targeted at trans children... Why?
 Why is my tax money being put towards alienating children and making 
their lives more difficult? Regardless of how an individual feels about 
transgender people, I see no reason as to why our state government 
should be wasting time and tax dollars to harm children over it. Are we 
not all entitled to the pursuit of happiness? I've lived in Virginia all
 my life, and plan to stay here for the rest of it, and it saddens me to
 see our beautiful state with so much potential wasting efforts on such 
an insignificant issue. Trans kids will still go on to pay taxes, have 
jobs, raise families, vote, and generally contribute to our society, 
regardless of gender identity. Why would we want them to hate Virginia? I
 believe we should be spending our resources on things that actually 
matter to GOVERNMENT. Libraries, schools, policies that benefit 
Virginia. Instead Youngkin wants to spend his time as Governor pushing 
his own beliefs onto children and families he doesn't know or understand
 the dynamic of. There is no benefit of doing this aside from harming 
trans people. And even if you don't like trans people, which in itself 
is incredibly reductive of a diverse group of human beings, how does 
making them hate Virginia and it's government benefit anybody? It all 
just seems so nonsensical. I really want to believe we are better than 
that, and I will be sure my vote and the vote of those around me 
reflects as much.</p>

<p>Children often rely on teachers and others at school to protect them 
from abuse at home. This bill will just increase the chances that LGBT+ 
youth will expertise that abuse</p>

<p>You clearly care nothing about trans kids but instead just want to 
pander to your base and invent issues where none exist. If a kid decides
 they are trans, and want to change their name and pronoun, who are you 
to tell them and their parents they cannot? You claim to want to restore
 parental rights, but this only succeeds in removing the parent from the
 discussion. The psychological harm you are inflicting on these kids is 
unconscionable, all to score brownie points with your base. I doubt 
anything I can say will sway you from this mean and damaging law, but 
hopefully the courts will stop you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you Governor,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of us have actually READ and understand that this doesn't 
negatively impact Trans children in any way, if any such child even 
exist without influence. It protects the parents right to educate their 
child at home about sexual preferences and understanding, which is 
exactly where those conversations belong- in the home.</p>
<p>The same people screaming rape culture and "Me too" are screaming 
against this, yet wouldn't you think they'd be behind protecting 
children at a young age? Otherwise, under the guise of educating 
children- its welcoming predators.. it's an invitation for predators to 
get around children and hide in plain sight. I in fact, do agree that 
everyone should be accepted and protected and therefore support 
this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all know the Catholic church is guilty of abusing and raping 
children under the guise of leading them to God and educating them. I'd 
never want sex acceptance or education conversations to happen to a 
young child in a public setting.. BIG PREDATOR VIBES IF YOU ARE MAD IT 
DOESNT HAPPEN.</p>

<p>We are luck enough to have several trans grandchildren.&nbsp; I have 
told them often that we would have been delighted whichever gender they 
had been introduced to us as at birth. Now that it turns out the doctors
 were wrong, we are delighted to know their true gender.&nbsp; We love 
them and support them. We strongly oppose this bill. Surely you know the
 suicide rates among people who are trans.&nbsp; It is terribly hard to 
be harrassed and bullied as one of our grandchildren was last year. Let 
us accept one another and worry about behavior that really matters -- 
cruelty and unkindness, not the gender of our children.</p>

<p>I grew up in a "Christian home" and my parents practiced "don't ask 
don't tell" before it was ever thought about.&nbsp; The only sex advice 
from my parents was "its a sin and its dirty".&nbsp; The governor might 
as well be signing death warrants when outing LGBTQ kids to their 
parents. It was terrifying growing up and to know I was different. If I 
were outed at such a young age, I can't imagine what I might have done 
to myself.&nbsp; The title "2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity,
 and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools" 
says it all. How can a minority of parents control&nbsp; the "privacy, 
dignity and respect for all students attending Virginia's Public 
Schools"? This policy. if enacted, and in my view, takes us backwards 
and will allow legal discrimination against a minority of 
students.&nbsp; Keep the politics out of our schools.</p>

<p>I find the Governor's policy not helpful and extremely harmful.&nbsp;
 Parents or a child that is struggling with this issue, need assistance 
and support. Not someone putting stones in their way!&nbsp; It is a very
 difficult decision for all involved, and the schools and govt agencies 
should be trying to assist them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incredibly cruel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new drafted guidelines will only increase depression and suicide 
rates in trans youth and make their lives even more difficult than it 
already is in the current climate. Outing trans children to unaccepting 
and hostile parents is dangerous. Parents should not be able to control 
every facet of their child's lives. There is no reason to require 
parental consent for what should be common decency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a Christian Minister, I am strongly opposed to this policy. I work
 with people who are transgender and I know how much pain and how afraid
 they are. Trans people are not dangerous but this policy is very 
dangerous. It will cause great harm to our children. Please educate 
yourself and stop pandering to people who react out of their own fear 
and ignorance.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with social transition. It gives kids the 
freedom to figure themselves out without the intervention of biased 
adults in their life. Banning this and forcing teachers to not only deny
 children the right to be themselves but also out them to potentially 
dangerous adults is unfathomably cruel and unnecessary.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a child cannot buy beer. Why is that? F a child cannot vote. Again
 why is that? If a child cannot serve in the military. Again why is 
that? One thing is why : Maturity level in youth. Parents are the 
deciders. Not the child or a school official. I support the Gov. On 
this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trans youth are are kids in your society too. They deserve to me 
accepted and protected in the educational setting just like other kids. 
The proposed plan by the governor of VA is doing more harm than good in 
our society. It is making a loud statement that transgender youth should
 not belong in our society. Other kids receive these messages which 
increases bullying in school. The rate that trans youth experience 
bullying, depression, suicidal thoughts and even attempt is tremendously
 higher than someone who is cisgender. I see it daily working as a 
social worker.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>lastly the proposal is taking away a trans persons right to choose. 
The right to disclose information when they are ready to whom they are 
ready. It is no one else’s place to makes decisions for another persons 
body then the person themselves. The ripple effects of something like 
this is greater than the population you are targeting. It effects 
everyone. Girls &nbsp;who look to masculine start to get questioned in 
sports, bullied for not being “enough” or the feeling they don’t belong.
 Gender expression should be just that and not one should tell you what 
box you need to fit into.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>I strongly oppose this proposal due to the harmful consequences it 
has on the youth, families and our community. All kids should have the 
right to feel comfortable, safe and accepted in school.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>Many teachers (I am one of them) are leaving the profession because 
we are forced to mislead&nbsp;students, lie to parents, say we agree

encouraging them to adopt a lifestyle that will only cause them harm in

<p>Schools should be safe spaces for all children. Youngkin’s proposal 
threatens our most vulnerable children, making them political pawns. 
Youngkin should care more about keeping our kids safe than about finding
 a “solution” to a problem of his own creation. Keep your band off our 
trans youth!</p>

<p>The previous guidelines from 2021 make the fundamental assumption 
that school personnel always have a child's best interests in mind 
whereas parents do not. This underlying assumption is demonstrably 
false, as borne out by all serious research and personal experience that
 point to biological parents as the strongest caregivers, advocates, and
 champions of their children. Government policy cannot be designed for 
the exception, but must ensure best protections for all. Bravo, Governor
 Younkin, for standing for the rights of all Virginia students with new 
2022 policies that respect the God-given rights of parents, the 
God-ordained dignity of all students, and the proper place of government
 which is outside the realm family affairs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a concerned parent, I strongly oppose these measures. I cannot 
fathom how this only will be used to discriminate children. School 
should be a safe space that is welcoming to students where they should 
go by whatever name they wish. Are we screening nicknames now? Teachers 
have enough to do without all of this time-wasting politicking. Please 
stop wasting everyone’s time and remove this proposed regulation.</p>

<p>The proposed Model Policies state up front: "All students have the 
right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, 
harassment, or bullying."</p>
<p>Why does this seemingly not apply to transgender students, or any 
student suspected of being transgender or otherwise 
gender-nonconforming, for that matter?</p>
<p>When an authority figure repeatedly and blatantly disregards an 
essential part of who a child is, that is bullying. The proposed Model 
Policies are a license for adults to bully at children's expense, and no
 other virtues can erase this stain.</p>
<p>I strongly oppose the proposed Model Policies.</p>

<p>Trans and LGBTQ kids need our protection! These rules are dangerous. 
They will cause active harm to our most vulnerable children. Our 
children deserve to be protected, not singled out for political 
purposes. This is the most egregious case of a person in power punching 
down. There are so many other important matters to address yet the 
governor wants to attack children. Not protecting LGBTQ and especially 
Trans kids leads to dire consequences. Utah has the highest rate of teen
 suicides because of their attitudes towards Trans and LGBTQ kids. Do 
not turn Virginia into that mess. Trans kids matter and should be 
protected!</p>

<p>This guidance does nothing more than give the false sense of "hope" 
to parents supporting this that their children will become "normal" if 
they are oppressed by expressing the gender identity they identify with 
but all this will bring is more fear, bullying, and destruction to the 
mental health and stability of kids across Virginia who will not only be
 afraid to express themselves in their homes but at school too. Kids 
will not prosper under uncomfortable conditions - fear only dampens 
growth. Protect the transgender youth of Virginia and you will find that
 students who are comfortable with themselves and their identity will 
become the bright future of our generation.</p>

<p>It's not that hard to respect trans kids. Schools make accommodations
 for their students all the time, such as for students with physical, 
mental, and learning disabilities, for example. (To be absolutely clear,
 being trans is NOT an illness or disability.) It's literally the BARE 
MINIMUM to address any child, cis or trans, by the name and pronouns 
they identify with and to respect their privacy. It hurts no one, but 
anti-trans laws DO hurt and kill trans kids. There's no valuable reason 
to pass something like this other than pure hatred.</p>

<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">I
 work in education in Virginia and have for the last 13 years.&nbsp; In 
that time, I have had several transgender students in my 
classroom.&nbsp; Some have even come to speak to me about coming out as 
trans during their time in my classroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Research
 shows us that it is monumentally important for us to create classrooms 
where students feel included.&nbsp; When they feel included, they feel 
safe and can learn to the best of their ability.&nbsp; Part of creating a
 safe environment for them includes using a preferred name and the 
correct pronouns for that student.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Parents
 do not always know what is best for their child.&nbsp; I have had a few
 students whose parents did not accept who they were when they were 
living at home.&nbsp; I've seen 18-year-old student sob in my office 
when they tell me they are gay and have always known but couldn't say 
anything.&nbsp; I have also had trans students tell me their childhood 
was miserable because they were discouraged from expressing their 
identity.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">My
 question is this--what does it hurt to allow trans students to be who 
they are?&nbsp; Is it a huge inconvenience to call a student by a 
preferred name?&nbsp; Don’t we already use nicknames?&nbsp; Is it a 
disruption to change pronouns or avoid using them with a student who 
doesn’t feel like they identify as one specific gender? Who does it hurt
 if a transgender student uses the bathroom that they identify 
with?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The answer is that it doesn’t hurt educators or other students at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">But it will hurt a transgender student if we refuse to support them and their identity.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">How
 many kids will needlessly suffer because of this policy?&nbsp; I am 
tired of hearing out of date teachers make statements like, “Well, what 
if the student says they identify as a tree today?&nbsp; Do I have to 
call them a tree?” They do not get it.&nbsp; It is not about students 
trying to “abuse” the system or agreeing or disagreeing with someone’s 
sexual and gender identity.&nbsp; It’s about supporting kids when they 
really need that support.&nbsp; It’s about creating a learning 
environment where all students feel included and valued for who they 
are.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">I
 don’t understand why we think we need to have a policy that states that
 parents are the decision makers about gender when it is clearly a 
personal, intrinsic decision.&nbsp; Parents may not understand their 
children—especially if they have never considered what it means to be 
LGBTQIA+ or what the experience is like for children who know they 
aren’t in the right body.</p>
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-left: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Let’s
 focus on what matters—not target a small vulnerable population of 
students who are already at risk for mental health issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I moved from Virginia in 2021 as a 15 year old trans woman, I 
was happy. I felt safe and comfortable. I knew that my privacy would be 
protected, and I could confide safely with teachers about my identity. 
But I have watched this year from afar as my home, my Virginia, is 
slipping into fascism. I have watched as Glenn Youngkin, a man elected 
by only a 2% margin, has become a majoritarian and “culture war” 
vulture. I watched as he ignored the public school districts of Virginia
 and banned mask mandates. I watched as he created a fake narrative of 
“critical race theory” being taught in Virginia schools and egged on 
racist parents to “report” their school districts and teachers. And now I
 watch as he has turned his eye towards, like the rest of his fascist 
gubernatorial neighbors, towards us. Transgender youth in Virginia. 
Youngkin’s plan forces transgender children to be outed by schools to 
their parents, who may be abusive and extremely transphobic. Youngkin’s 
plan also forces schools to deadname and misgender children, which will 
crush their spirits even more than they already have been by the 
pressure of being transgender in America. Enough of this, Glenn 
Youngkin. Your policies will cause people to be killed, either by their 
own or someone else’s hand.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dear Governor Youngkin and VA Department of Education administration,</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">As a person of faith, parent of a school-aged child, 
adjunct professor, religious freedom and interfaith advocate, I am 
deeply disturbed by your proposed 2022 model policies and OPPOSE them. 
Whereas, you suggest that Virginia parents have the right to make 
decisions about our children; these policies actually prioritize the 
ideologies, rights, and concerns of a particular group of parents. This 
will cause great division in the Commonwealth in ways that your 
administration has not considered. Quite candidly, these policies 
violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the US 
Constitution because they show favor towards one religious group over 
another. That’s a form of Christian Nationalism, Governor. Religion 
should never be used as weapon to cause harm. Furthermore, it does not 
take into consideration employees of Virginia public schools who may 
support LGBTQ youth or even have a transgender child. This puts them in a
 very awkward position as an educator and provider of their household. 
If you are working on behalf of all Virginia families and students, your
 policies should be neutral and not show preference towards one set of 
religious beliefs over another. Nor should these policies present a 
threat towards transgender students in spaces where they should be 
welcomed and protected regardless of their religious, sexual, gender, 
racial, and any other identities.&nbsp; Hear directly from one Virginia 
transgender student:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>“As a transgender student who endured the American 
public school system, I carry my share of traumatic experiences that 
make this a very tangible concern for me. Our identities are not an 
“ideology”, they’re simply who we are. Putting us in harm’s way over a 
perceived difference in “belief” is a disgusting and dehumanizing 
overreach of governmental authority as well as a violation of adolescent
 human dignity contrary to the alleged (but unsupported by the body of 
the Model Policies) interests of the Act. If nothing else, it is a 
statistically sound means of raising the transgender suicide and at-home
 abuse rates. …Transgender human beings, especially not minors, do not 
deserve to be told through legislative code that they are better off 
dead or hurting.”</em></p>
<p><strong><br></strong>Governor Youngkin, the Trevor Project estimates that more than <a rel="nofollow" x="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/trvr_press/national-estimate-of-lgbtq-youth-seriously-considering-suicide/">1.8 million</a> LGBTQ youth (13-24) seriously consider suicide each year in the U.S. — and at least one attempts suicide <a rel="nofollow" x="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/2021/03/11/estimate-of-how-often-lgbtq-youth-attempt-suicide-in-the-u-s/">every 45 seconds</a>.
 Last week, I spoke with the parent of a transgender teenage girl who 
expressed concerns about potential increase in suicides as a result of 
this public policy that opens the flood gates of discrimination, 
bigotry, and hostility in public schools. This breaks my heart. As a 
parent and person of faith, I implore you to reconsider these 
emotionally, mentally, and spiritually damaging policies to show 
compassion for the most vulnerable: our students.</p>
<p>For the love of human dignity and inclusion,</p>
<p>Dr. Sabrina Dent</p>

<p>Regardless of how someone sees themselves, people should be treated 
with respect. If someone didn't call you by your name, you'd rightfully 
be disrespected. Why is it that the state gets to tell people what 
they're called instead of themselves? This is a blatant attack against 
civil liberties, as people are their own beings. No state or authority 
should be able to enforce an identity, especially when someone 
specifically asks to not go by that. Playing on peoples' prejudices is 
the same justification given to not desegregate schools, both of which 
are gross government oversteps that enforced the horrible treatment of 
others. This country is founded on the idea of giving everyone an equal 
chance to then have them act how they see fit, and enforcing 
discrimination takes away from that central idea. I would urge everyone 
regardless of political party (I'm a Republican) to oppose this as it 
takes away from what makes America great, the true land of the free!</p>

<p>You did NOT campaign on this, nor was it in your platform. Shame on 
you. This is straight up bullying. How is it the government’s business 
what name a student uses, or which pronouns they prefer? Only parents of
 white, Christian cisgender children have any say in their children’s 
public school education. I thought you wanted local school boards to 
have autonomy? The hypocrisy is next level. I strongly oppose this 
policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>This abhorrent bill will force trans kids without an 
affirming home life to be ripped from the one place that could give them
 solace. Being trans at school is already hard on it’s own but when 
teachers can no longer provide safe spaces because they’re required to 
out you to their parents, legally cannot call you by your preferred name
 or pronouns, and police which bathroom you use, you are creating a 
second extremely hostile environment, and these kids have nowhere else 
to go. People often bring up trans suicide rates but don’t talk about 
the hostile environments which cause those rates. Trans kids are 90% 
less likely to commit suicide if they are supported by even one person 
in their life, it’s not hard to make schools that place. This bill will 
increase the rate of suicide amongst trans youth and it must not be 
enacted.</strong></p>

<p>As a parent, religious educator, and adult who cares deeply about 
trans, non-binary, and gender expansive kids, I oppose these new Model 
Policies with every ounce of my spirit. This is not about parents' 
rights. It is about the rights of children and youth to know themselves 
and have those identities affirmed and respected. Trans young people 
face significantly increased risk of self-harm and suicide NOT because 
they are trans or non-binary, but because they are stigmatized and 
marginalized by the adults who should be protecting them. These policies
 INCREASE that risk, which is an unconscionable thing to do to 
children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cisgender girls and young women are not at risk in restrooms or 
locker rooms from trans kids. Stop buying into this false narrative that
 only props up bigotry. Give kids the safety, dignity, and respect they 
deserve.</p>

<p>Gov Younkin’s trans policy is despicable and has nothing to do with 
family values or privacy or parent’s rights. It’s sole purpose is to 
kowtow to the right wing to gain brownie points, in hopes of generating 
enough support for a run at the presidency. Sick, self-serving, and 
invasive.</p>

<p>I strongly agree with this policy. My heart goes out to those 
children who are confused and think they are something they are 
not.&nbsp; However, these mental issues need to be addressed by 
professionals. The schools should not compound the issues by&nbsp; 
appeasing to the mentally ill. &nbsp; Instead they should be focused on 
getting them the help that they actually need.</p>
<p>Many of these children are not even actually mentally ill but just 
misguided and confused. They are constantly bombarded with illogical 
propaganda.</p>

<p>These changes are giving reasons for discriminating against an 
already discriminated sliver of society. Teach all children equally and 
the religious beliefs of Teachers, Administrators and Politicians should
 never be enforced onto any populace, least of all children. This is an 
unnecessary change to the rules that can only be used to cause harm, it 
should NOT be implemented.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a Loudoun County parent and teacher, I strongly oppose the 
governor’s recent decision to remove rights and protections from 
transgender students in VA public schools. The measure is cruel and 
dangerous and will undoubtedly lead to tragic outcomes, including abuse 
towards these students both in school and at home, as well as increased 
rates of suicide. The governor’s determination to tear down the public 
school system has already led to distrust between parents and educators 
based on fear rather than truth, and vulnerable students will pay the 
price for this latest political stunt based purely in discriminatory 
hate. Virginians will not stand for this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>why do you dare to out trans students? they deserve the same respect 
as their peers. how dare you use their identity against them? they were 
comfortable themselves to come out in school, but you want to subject 
them to pain or torture from their parents (who may or may not "approve"
 of their choice? why are you taking away their options, their choices? 
is it not their lives? don't allow a GROWN adult to take away future 
aspects of a CHILD's life just because of beliefs. it has NOTHING to do 
with beliefs, when it comes to a child. it goes in their favor, and not 
yours.</p>

<p>The new model guidance (2022) is better than the 2021 model guidance 
in that it addresses the privacy, dignity and respect of all students 
and acknowledges the key role of parents in the education of their 
children.&nbsp; It also cites the remedies already available to deal 
with bullying, discrimination and harassment.</p>

<p>Kids explore their personalities in lots of different ways - they 
play pretend, dress up, games, sports, theatre, music, etc etc. Kids 
should be allowed to try different names and pronouns and outfits if 
that’s part of figuring out who they are as people.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>lods who are not allowed or supported in exploring their 
personalities and gender identities are much more likely to develop 
anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts and actions.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>i would much rather have kids using they/them or zi/zir pronouns than have any child believe they’re better off dead.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>do not put these proposed changes into action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transphobic measures like these are not based on fact or science and 
literally kill trans kids. Read the American Academy of Pediatrics 
statement on trans youth and the statistics on suicide. Stop using 
children’s lives as a political bargaining chip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I support trans lives - that means letting people be who they are, no
 matter what age. Trans people aren’t hurting anyone, they are just 
seeking respect and happiness like any other person. Trans kids ought to
 be addressed by the names and pronouns they want to be called, just 
like a cisgender child is able to choose a nickname. They must have 
unimpeded access to public bathrooms, lest they develop health problems 
associated with avoiding urination. And they must not be outed to 
unsupportive parents who will abuse them! Let trans kids live! No one is
 forcing anything on them! There is no “grooming” going on! Trans people
 are real and should be supported in their identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is already such a challenge growing up as a child these days, 
between the presence of social media, the impact that the pandemic has 
had on our children’s mental health and normal development, and now 
there’s proposed laws such as this coming up. How do we have the right 
to say, “I’m sorry but I refuse to recognize how you identify and who 
you are?” The fact of the matter is that what’s wrong with this picture 
is the adults who refuse to think outside of the narrow-minded views 
they have, NOT the children. If we care about our children and want 
what’s best for them, encouraging them to be themselves and recognizing 
their pronouns is one of the simplest ways to show we are here to help 
them. </p>
<p>I am a nurse and I am beyond concerned about the increase in mental 
health-related admissions and suicide attempts amongst trans youth. It 
is beyond comprehension to me how people believe that there is not a 
correlation between these types of laws and views and the increase in 
mental health challenges. We must PROTECT trans youth, and this only 
hurts them. I am vehemently opposed to this bill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stop targeting some of the most marginalized and vulnerable among us.
 These kids and their parents who are already facing a much harder road 
created by this society for just being themselves. Accommodating their 
needs is not difficult... why not make their lives just a little easier,
 respectful and kind?&nbsp; Take the target off these children's backs!</p>

<p>This policy is so backward I don't even know where to begin, but I 
will start with the obvious reasons as to why it is completely 
pointless. It makes no difference which restroom a student uses. If a 
student who was deemed female at birth uses the male restrooms, they 
will need to go into a stall to use the toilet since urinals are not 
functional for them. If a student who was deemed male at birth uses the 
female restrooms, they will be going into a stall because that is all 
there are in female restrooms.</p>
<p>Either way, the students using the restroom that don't correspond 
with their gender at birth will be IN A STALL with a door closed. So, 
what's the problem? Was this policy set forth JUST to make a political 
statement? It would appear so since the "reasons" they give are totally 
irrelevant. Either way, it is a kid, using a restroom with a door 
closed. Why in the world would you need a policy about that if not to 
make a political statement? Maybe we could focus our attention on things
 that actually matter rather than pointlessly making transgender 
students feel discriminated against?</p>

<p>My child is nonbinary - and this policy was written specifically to 
remove any references of gender from schools.&nbsp; Any school system 
that adopts this policy will not allow any teacher to acknowledge 
students who do not identify as male or female.&nbsp; <strong>This is in
 direct opposition to the Virginia Human Rights act that prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of gender identity - and the law includes 
educational institutions.</strong>&nbsp; Prohibiting a school from recognizing a nonbinary child as who they are is discrimination.</p>
<p>It cites studies that highlight the importance of family involvement 
in children's lives - but ignores the fact that 2 out of 3 families 
aren't supportive of transgender children.&nbsp; It ignores the fact 
that lack of family support - and support at school is exactly what 
drives these children to consider taking their own lives.&nbsp; If 
anything - the studies that you've cited in this document support the 
fact that families need to be more accepting of these students.</p>
<p>Despite the stated objectives -&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this policy was really about Parental Rights - I would be able to 
request that the school address my child as they/them - instead of just 
male or female</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">If this policy was really about 
Parental Rights - we wouldn’t be required to provide legal documents 
just to have our children addressed by their chosen name at school</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">If this policy was really about Freedom
 of Speech - supportive teachers wouldn’t be forced to ignore a 
student’s chosen name, or their gender just because of what their birth 
certificate says</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">If this policy was really about Freedom
 of Religion - it wouldn’t ignore those whose religion call on them to 
treat others with compassion instead of disrespect</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">If this policy was really about All Students - it wouldn’t exclude the most vulnerable students</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">If this policy was really about 
Preventing Bullying - it wouldn’t devote almost every legal argument to 
legitimizing unsupportive parents and bigotry</p>
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">If this policy was really about The Truth - they wouldn’t need to redefine words to bend their meaning</p>

<p>This policy will kill kids. All children deserve to feel safe and 
comfortable at school and all children deserve a fair education. Putting
 this policy in place puts trans kids in harm and creates a space for 
harm to be done. Support trans youth and OPPOSE THIS POLICY! &nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the new propose model guidance policy and oppose 
any enforcement on school division who do not adopt the propose 
guidelines. The policy is discrimintory towards Transgender individuals 
who are a protected class by title XI.</p>

<p>I am a concerned community member and I strongly oppose this 
guidance. From my experience as a student, I’ve seen trans students 
struggle to focus on their studies because they need to spend time 
worrying about trivial things such as where to use the bathroom instead.
 This guidance will make it harder for trans students to get the support
 they need in order to succeed in school. Our main priority should be to
 make sure students are in a comfortable environment where they can 
focus on their studies, not worry about their safety&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>This new policy will undoubtedly lead to increased harassment and bullying of trans students.</strong></p>
<p>The weak language that schools should "attempt" and "make every 
effort" to respect a student's identity/pronouns are completely 
undermined by the rest of the policy -- specifically, the direction to 
separate athletics programs, locker rooms, and other school 
events/facilities by biological sex; forcing schools to out trans 
students to their parents even when it puts them in harm's way (when not
 all parents are good parents, a safe school environment is all the more
 important!); and a lack of any consequences for, or resources to 
address, any teachers or students that disrespect a trans student's 
identity. It also fails to acknowledge or address intersex or nonbinary 
students.</p>
<p>This policy regards trans students as second-class citizens, with limited rights.</p>
<p>This policy endangers trans students, in violation of the Virginia Human Rights Act.</p>
<p>This policy does not treat trans students with the respect and care that they deserve.</p>
<p>We can be better than this.</p>

<p>Respecting childrens’ rights to self identify does absolutely nothing
 to hinder education. In fact, it only hinders the education of trans 
kids, as it is unnecessary trauma to be forced to be something they are 
not. PROTECT TRANS RIGHTS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The level of cynicism we have come to expect from Glenn Youngkin and 
his party is on full display with this Model Policies proposal. It is 
not for him and his Cabinet of Cronies to decide if a child is safe 
coming out to their parents. The rapport and trust a student has in 
their teacher should be regarded as almost sacred, not as weaponized 
political pawns. These are our most vulnerable children, least able to 
protect themselves against bullying, which can lead to harm and suicidal
 ideation. These monsters should stop using fear to aggravate the 
families. Gender dysphoria has never been proven to be a cause of 
predatory behavior. This cabal should be ashamed or themselves for 
exposing our students to harm just because they can.</p>
<p>Their thought process in no way represents the preponderance of the 
Commonwealth of Virginia citizens. We understand the ultimate goal: to 
arouse sufficient fear that discredits our fine public education system.
 Privatizing education has never helped families, it merely lines the 
pockets of the "buy, gut, and sell" privateers. Charter schools have a 
lifespan of about five years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>WE ALL KNOW THE END GOAL of this. Public education has historically 
been a soft constituency. We are organized, focused, and fearless. We 
fight for our public school system and its families.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm going to begin with a quote taken from the 
guidance document that was provided. "All students have the right to 
attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or
 bullying." ALL students have the right to attend school free from 
discrimination. You can not say that all students have a right to attend
 school free from discrimination while actively trying to release a 
policy that discriminates against trans students. You think you're 
protecting the students, but really, you're harming them. For some 
students, it may be safe to get parental approval. But for some 
students, it's not safe to do so. So they are forced to be uncomfortable
 in their own skin both at home and in school, or put themselves in 
danger. I can say, at 22, I'm still not out to my parents in any regard,
 for this reason. I spent all of high school hiding who I was just so I 
could be safe, and that made me absolutely miserable. The only reason 
I'm not dead is because I cared too much about my friends. Now that I'm 
out of college and living on my own, I'm able to be myself, away from my
 family, and I am so much happier for it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I
 hear the argument frequently of "it's just a phase, they'll grow out of
 it". So what if it's just a phase? Children should feel supported and 
encouraged, not stifled. When I was a kid I wanted to be a princess when
 I grew up. That was obviously a phase, yet nobody batted an eye or 
complained in the slightest. I think our priority should be making sure 
students feel safe and encouraged, and we can coddle the parents 
later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the new transgender/non-binary student policy 
proposed by the governor. It is our role as adults to protect children 
from discrimination and abuse. This policy is definitely not supporting 
vulnerable students. Gender identity and sexual orientation are hard 
wired at birth. It’s biology, not choice. We must allow our children to 
live as their authentic selves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Youngkin panders to his base, children will be at higher risk 
for mental health issues and suicidal ideation. The pro-life crowd isn't
 so pro-life when it comes to welcoming and accepting transgender 
students. Please reconsider this dangerous policy change for the sake of
 Virginia's children.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this measure by Gov. Youngkin.&nbsp; &nbsp;Do not 
bully our children, this behavior is unacceptable.&nbsp; Do not try and 
climb the political ladder by standing on the backs of trans students.</p>

<p>These drafted policies would essentially force school counselors to 
out trans students to their parents before they are ready. As school 
counselors, we don't bring up conversations about gender with kids in 
individual counseling, but kids will often bring it up themselves. We 
have to talk to them in an affirming and safe environment. It is 
essential for LGBTQ+ youth to come out to their families themselves, 
when and if they feel safe to do so.</p>
<p>The primary reason it is so important to affirm, protect, and create 
safe spaces at school for LGBTQ+ children is because LGBT adolescents 
are more likely than other kids their age to attempt suicide. Overall, 
sexual minority youth were 3.5 times as likely to attempt suicide as 
heterosexual peers. Transgender adolescents were 5.87 times more likely,
 gay and lesbian adolescents were 3.71 times more likely and bisexual 
youth were 3.69 times more likely than heterosexual peers to attempt 
suicide. <a rel="nofollow" x="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-lgbt-teen-suicide/lgbt-youth-at-higher-risk-for-suicide-attempts-idUSKCN1MI1SL">(Reuters 2018)&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>This bill not only destroys children's already very overstepped right
 to privacy, this will result in the breakage of the school system using
 a scapegoat as a catalyst, we see through your political agenda, 
Virginia Republicans. WE see your attempts to break up families and 
destroy the lives of kids unborn for a simple party race. I fully 
believe that were the burning of the library of sexualwiszencraft were 
to happen today, Virginia Republicans would celebrate such genocidal 
action. If this is going to be a part of the neo-civil war Era, Virginia
 Republicans are on the absolute worst side of it. That much is clear.</p>

<p>I strongly support parents' rights regarding their children. While I 
sympathize with Transkids, they need to look to their parents for 
support, not the school systems. The schools are leading these misguided
 kids in to deeper waters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a parent of two teens, I find it appalling that this guidance 
takes back protections of trans youth. &nbsp;It is our responsibility to
 lead by example, and I want my children to know that they will be safe 
at school no matter who they are. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Schools should be welcoming for all students, no matter their 
background. Outting kids to their parents can put them directly into an 
unsafe situation at home. It's insane that Youngkin's administration and
 the Republican Party is still using horrible and antiquated tropes to 
demonize LGBTQ+ students and create hostile school environments. Schools
 are stressful places already, why make it harder on them when all these
 are kids trying to be is themselves? Other kids are uncomfortable? That
 sounds like a teachable moment to me. The world is diverse. Virginia is
 more diverse than ever before, and people just need to make peace with 
that. Trans kids have always been here and demonizing won't change that.
 It'll only hurt kids.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The governor’s policies will cause the deaths of trans children. 
There is no mistaking it. When queer and and trans children are 
forbidden from being who they are, and are treated with state-sanctioned
 contempt and harm, they will die. This guidance is clearly meant to 
serve as a fascist dogwhistle to continue to oppress those that 
conservatives deem undesirable.</p>
<p>The central framing of this guidance is also wrong; children are 
humans who are deserving of autonomy. This guidance places the right of 
parents to control their children over the rights of children to exist 
as individuals. The fact that “schools shall respect all children” is 
the LAST principle speaks volumes to what Gov Youngkin thinks the 
purpose of school is.</p>
<p>Furthermore, how can we trust Gov Youngkin to have the interests of 
all children in the state of Virginia when his proposed policies 
regarding harassment in schools fail to provide safeguards against 
harassment and discrimination on the basis of sexuality, gender 
identity, or gender expression? When many students, both LGBTQ+ and not,
 face harassment in this way, and in some cases face harassment so 
extreme it causes withdrawing from school, moving, great physical and or
 emotional harm, or even death? The answer is that we cannot trust the 
governor, as he does not care. He has told us who he sees as human. 
LGBTQ+ children are not human to him.</p>

<p>So just because a trans kid's parents don't support who their 
children are, teachers will be forced to treat them with that same 
disrespect? How is mandating a hostile schooling environment going to 
make anything better for anyone?</p>
<p>"The gender-affirming model of care affirms diversity in gender 
identity and assists individuals in defining, exploring, and actualizing
 their gender identity, allowing for exploration without judgments or 
assumptions. This does not mean that all youth need to undergo medical 
transition; indeed, this is often not the case. Gender-affirming care is
 highly individualized and focuses on the needs of each individual by 
including psychoeducation about gender and sexuality (appropriate to age
 and developmental level), parental and family support, social 
interventions, and gender-affirming medical interventions.</p>
<p>It is well documented that TGNB adolescents and young adults 
experience anxiety and depression, as well as suicidal ideation, at a 
much higher rate than their cisgender peers. According to The Trevor 
Project’s 2020 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health, <strong>54 
percent of young people who identified as transgender or nonbinary 
reported having seriously considered suicide in the last year, and 29 
percent have made an attempt to end their lives. In contrast, numerous 
research studies have found that gender-affirming care leads to improved
 mental health among TGNB youth.</strong>"</p>

<p>Thank you for doing just that. &nbsp;Good work. Those who don’t see 
that this protects everyone don’t really want to protect children but 
rather want to protect an agenda&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a horrible decision that flies in the face of all medical and
 psychological research findings. Far from protecting children, it is 
incredibly harmful to them. For transgender or gender non-conforming 
children in unsupportive households, school may be the only place where 
they are free to be themselves — destroying that freedom puts them at 
massively increased risk of self-harm and suicide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Virginia voter, DO NOT enact this awful policy.</p>

<p>This legislation is harmful and counterproductive. It completely 
discounts the mountain of existing evidence-based guidance put forth by 
experts in the fields of child psychology and behavior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than spending taxpayer dollars on genital- centric policies 
that strip children of their rights to privacy and the pursuit of 
happiness, focus on updating our public schools with gender-neutral 
facilities and programs. This way all students can go about their day 
without having to publicly announce their sex to gain entry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before this trans hysteria began, where I'm from, it's common for 
teachers to ask students if they have a nickname they would like to use 
in class. I don't recall that ever needing to be parent-approved. This 
should be no different. Refer to kids the way they would prefer. It 
harms no one but does a world of good for the kids. Please understand 
that "outing" a student to their parents over a name or a pronoun could 
lead directly to abuse, abandonment, or worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll also say that sex-segregated sports should be a thing of the 
past. I'd challenge anyone to look at the roster for any U8-U12 league 
and tell me the teams are "fair" to all players. I constantly hear 
outrage about trans kids having an advantage over their teammates, 
especially trans girls. Next time you're on the sports field, look at 
the height/weight differences among the players of those ages. Girls 
that are 4' 75lbs could easily be on the same team as girls 5'3" 130lbs.
 However, because they're assigned female at birth, that's considered 
fair. You can't argue that trans girls are bigger/faster/stronger when 
statistically, girls assigned female at birth are all over the spectrum 
of weight and height too!</p>
<p>Stop these harmful dehumanizing policies. Stop worrying about what's 
in our kids' pants and start working on legislation that will make 
everyone welcome and comfortable in their own skin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am in favor of retaining the March 2021 model policies and not in 
favor of implementing the 2022 model policies at all. I was a 
transgender student in Virginia public schools in the early to 
mid-2000's. Bullying was rampant at the school where I attended and 
understanding of and compassion for transgender issues was virtually 
non-existent. As a student, I would have benefitted under the 2021 model
 policies and been actively harmed by the 2022 model policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is striking that the title of the 2021 model policies includes the
 word transgender, but the 2022 model policies do not. That change is 
transphobic through distancing the policy from the very group the policy
 covers. The 2021 model also begins by defining terms related to gender 
identity which serves to ground the policy and demonstrates a knowledge 
of the issues. The 2022 policy by contrast, is bereft of any definitions
 for the terminology it uses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was sexually assaulted in school by a classmate who presumed I was 
gay. My parents were informed about the sexual assault by the principal 
of the school but not the reason why. My parents were homophobic and 
transphobic. If they had been informed about the reason at the time, I 
may have ended up being homeless. The greatest flaw that I see in the 
2022 model policies is the belief that parents will be willing to 
partner with schools and that informing a parent about a child's gender 
identity or sexuality is always in the child's best interest. Some of us
 came from broken homes and had to be our own parents. I would go so far
 as to state that I might not have survived my own childhood had the 
2022 model guidance been in place at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parental rights and transgender rights can both be satisfied while 
still maintaining the safety and dignity of trans people. We seem to be 
so hung up on what happens to children and rightfully so, but in some 
ways we treat them as independent individuals and in some ways we do 
not. School is a place where they are defined by their individuality and
 not their family/parents, therefore, they should feel empowered to be 
treated as they are, individuals who have a right to their bodies and 
identities. Advocating for respect as the Model Documents of 2021 did is
 nothing but reasonable. Why do we let parents' fear overpower the 
rights of young people?</p>

<p>Stop picking on children. &nbsp;They deserve so much better. Teachers

<p>The leftist, Marxist’s attack on our children is political and evil. 
School is for learning math, English, science, and history. NOT the 
destruction of innocence through the sexualization and lie of the 
transgender directive from the sick individuals that want to promote 
their agenda to innocent children. Thank you Glenn Youngkin for fighting
 for the lives of our children. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>2022 guidance is a disgusting 180 about face from the 2021 guidance 
document.&nbsp; 2022 makes no effort to explain how gender is a 
religious issue and would affect anyone of any faith.&nbsp; How a person
 identifies themselves is not affected by anyone elses beliefs.&nbsp; It
 is harmful, fascisit, transparent and ultimately damaging to these 
young people and virginia.&nbsp; The 2022 guidance document should be 
tossed in the trash heap along with whichever idiot wrote 
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trans students matter. Parents of trans students matter too. With 
this policy, you force them to endure bigotry and force their identities
 under the microscope to be picked apart by society and their peers. 
Where is the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect in that?</p>
<p dir="ltr">These model policies are rooted in transphobia and only 
seek to further harm trans and non-binary kids. They create a hostile 
and potentially dangerous school environment for those same students as 
they require teachers and staff to “forcibly out” students to their 
parents against the student’s will, even in cases where students seek 
counseling for abusive at home environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By not allowing teachers to use students' gender affirming 
names and gender affirming pronouns, you subject them to mental anguish,
 torment, and bullying at the hands of their peers, and in some cases, 
downright violence. These students will undoubtedly be physically hurt 
by other students out of lack of understanding and intolerance, but 
unfortunately, statistics point to these students dying by suicide 
because of the toxic and unsafe environments that they are put 
into.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These policies claim to protect students from “forced social 
transitioning.” Ironically, these policies are what is forcing kids to 
accept genders that aren’t their own. None of this seems to emphasize 
"privacy, respect, and dignity" in Virginia Public Schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The harm to students and their families aside, these policies are 
pretty much illegal in the eye of state law and also go against legal 
precedent ruled on by the highest courts in the United States based on 
cases from right here in the Commonwealth of Virginia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gavin Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board was ruled in favor of 
Gavin Grimm, not once but TWICE, which made a sweeping declaration that 
trans students should not be forced to use the bathrooms of the genders 
they were assigned at birth. These policies would go against the rulings
 of the nations' highest courts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2021, Governor Ralph Northam signed the Virginia Values 
Act into law after it was passed through the General Assembly. This law 
sweepingly, effectively prohibited discrimination in public and private 
employment, credit, housing, and public accommodations on the basis of 
sexual orientation and gender identity, among other additional protected
 categories. The protections in this act have been extended to protect 
LGBTQ+ youth in Virginia public schools throughout the Commonwealth to 
prohibit discrimination, harassment, and violence in against these 
students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This anti-trans campaign and policy has real life consequences for 
many people and it’s taken out on children who are trying to find their 
identity, like any kid should be able to do in their own experience and 
on their own time. This is a blatant and egregious attack on trans 
students in the Commonwealth and puts innocent children under harsh and 
brutal scrutiny for just trying to live their lives as who they truly 
are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to show that trans kids matter, trans people matter, and that
 they should be uplifted and supported, not persecuted and 
oppressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I urge you to do away 
with this policy and get back to supporting ALL of our Virginia public 
school students.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>I strongly oppose this policy. </strong>This policy is 
anti-children. This administration claims they want to empower parents 
to have a say in their child's education, but they clearly only want to 
empower straight cis children &amp; parents. ALL children, including 
trans and lgbtq+ children, have a right to life, liberty, and happiness.
 I will not sit by and let hatred be a part of my state.</p>

<p>I have 4 children and strongly believe that the school systems and 
government do not need to be making decisions for my children without my
 involvement. Shame on all the people who are willing to hand their 
children and other people's children over to the evil one. God gave 
those children to you, not the schools! Do your job - raise your 
children properly - get involved and stop looking to others to take your
 place.</p>

<p>While much of the proposed policy seems reasonable and well-balanced 
to support parents, I oppose the proposed policy. Outing trans and/or 
LGBT+ students to their parents without their consent will result in 
increased homelessness and suicide. How do schools intend to support the
 very students they will assuredly make homeless and/or suicidal? Please
 see: <a rel="nofollow" x="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/research-briefs/homelessness-and-housing-instability-among-lgbtq-youth-feb-2022/">https://www.thetrevorproject.org/research-briefs/homelessness-and-housing-instability-among-lgbtq-youth-feb-2022/.</a></p>
<p>Additionally, the proposed policy is vague in addressing trans 
students with their preferred pronouns using parental consent as 
guidance. How do schools intend to address students whose parents are 
divorced or were never married, share equal custody, but disagree on how
 their child should be addressed at school?</p>
<p>Whatsmore, how do schools intend to enforce how trans students are 
addressed by teachers, administrators, and staff? If a parent instructs 
their child's school to address them with their preferred name and 
pronouns, will school staff face consequences for refusing to do so? It 
would seem not, based on this proposed policy.</p>
<p>This proposed policy does little to protect trans students in the 
care of Virginia schools. It should be opposed and, at a minimum, 
revised to address the above concerns.</p>

<p>We need to protect children and the people who do that best are their
 parents. People who argue that parents shouldn’t know what their kids 
are doing in school should ask themselves if they’d be ok being kept out
 of decisions about their childrens regarding other issues&nbsp;</p>

<p>I believe we need to protect children who believe their sexual identity is different from the basic male/female identity.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the forced outing of trans students to their 
parents. Teachers are custodians of Virginia children's learning 
environments, and should not be forced to expose children to potential 
abuse from parents. To transphobes and similar who would force teachers 
and educators into a nonsensical culture war to boost Trumpkin's poll 
numbers, I say "nuts!"</p>

<p>This school policy removing protections for trans and nonbinary 
students flies in the face of evidence based best practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am a former FCPS employee and an MSW. I am horrified by this proposed guidance.</p>
<p>Public schools may be the first and in some cases the <strong>only</strong>
 places where trans students can safely by out. This guidance would take
 away that safety and literally put students' physical safety at risk. </p>
<p>Also - deadnaming (using a trans student's birth name) and misgendering (using the incorrect pronouns) causes emotional harm.</p>
<p>This proposed guidance is dangerous and unacceptable. I cannot express how essential it is that these proposals are <strong>not </strong>accepted and do not move forward.</p>

<p>Children are people, not property or political pawns. Respect their 
privacy and their personal expression. Let's not pretend that terrible 
parents don't exist in the world--adults are absolutely capable of 
harming their own children if they don't align with their beliefs. 
Outing trans kids puts them in danger. Supporting them helps them thrive
 and grow up to be productive members of society.</p>

<p>As a Charlottesville City teacher, and parent, I strongly oppose the 
governor’s recent decision to remove rights and protections from 
transgender students in VA public schools. The measure is cruel and 
dangerous and will undoubtedly lead to tragic outcomes, including abuse 
towards these students both in school and at home, as well as increased 
rates of suicide. The idiotic governor’s determination to tear down the 
public school system has already led to distrust between parents and 
educators based on fear rather than truth, and vulnerable students will 
pay the price for this latest political stunt based purely in 
discriminatory hate. Virginians will not stand for this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly opposed this proposed guidance. I am a parent of multiple 
children in the public school system. Forcing teachers and staff to 
report on students' gender identity is antithetical to student safety. 
This is political hackery masquerading as policy. Calling this guidance 
as supportive of "parents rights" is baloney and is clearly intended to 
target students who may fear for their safety in their unsupportive 
homes. This proposed guidance has nothing to do with children's 
well-being and everything to do with attempts to threaten and punish 
gender non-conformity. This guidance is actively harmful and must be 
revised to protect students safety by reverting to the previous 
standards.</p>

<p>As a citizen of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I am adamantly against 
the Governor's model policies concerning trans students. These policies 
are vindictive, intended to trap queer children and chain them to the 
whims of their parents—in the face of decades of evidence that queer 
children often suffer much of the worst abuse from their own families. 
The trans community at large faces some of the highest rates of 
violence, depression, and suicide within the queer community, making 
these rules especially pernicious and cruel.</p>
<p>Glenn Youngkin is just another in a long line of weak, feeble men 
willing to accumulate personal power and political capital by beating on
 a group of people with little say in their own affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good people of Virginia have fought and defeated men like him in 
the past. My ancestor, a Virginian, did as much when we knocked the 
British out of the colonies. I have every confidence that we shall do so
 again. The trans and other queer children growing up under this regime 
will never forget what Republicans have tried to do with their lives.</p>

<p>If these “protections“ are already in place in the 14th amendment,

this policy change serving?</p>

<p>I believe that the language in this is inclusive and sensitive to the
 rights of parents, and the transgender youth. We as a society have to 
stop pandering to what amounts to a very small minority at the expense 
of the majority. This proposal does not take any rights away from 
transgender people. It simply states that parents have a right to know 
what their children are up to at school. It will put the decision in the
 hands of parents and local school officials rather than the state. I 
fully support this and think that it's about time the Commonwealth took a
 step back from these policies that take parents out of the process.</p>

<p>Thank you for supporting parent’s rights and control over their 
children’s education as well as protecting them from influences contrary
 to their values. I have love for all people. Giving parents a say in 
their children’s education is in no way racist or hateful. For 
uninformed people to make this to be something “nazi” or ugly, or 
anti-trans, is a complete lie. Remember it was the Nazis and Communists 
who said the government knows better how to raise children and barred 
parents from having input or influence!</p>

<p>I support Gov Youngkin's policy and strongly believe that the school 
systems and government do not need to be making decisions for my 
children without my involvement. Shame on all the people who are willing
 to hand their children and other people's children over to the evil 
one. God gave those children to you, not the schools! Do your job - 
raise your children properly - get involved and stop looking to others 
to take your place.</p>

<p>Telling children they can be a different gender is the same thing as 
telling them they can be a different ethnicity. Cutting off childrens 
body parts is demonic. How would you respond to a child who said he or 
she felt like he or she was meant to only have one arm and that their 
body feels wrong to them with two. Would you allow them to cut that 
painful arm off</p>

          <strong>A child's right to feel safe at school and at home supersedes a parent's rights</strong>

<p>We accept that there are limits on people's rights when they result 
in the injury of others.&nbsp; Hence the oft cited quote, "Your right to
 swing your fist ends at my nose."&nbsp; We use this principal to 
protect children from corporal punishment at school (Virginia Code 
22.1-279.1) and from sexual assault anywhere (Virginia Code 18.2-370). 
&nbsp;(Maslow cited the need for safety as one of the basic needs for 
human development.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>Transgender students have the right to feel safe in their bodily and 
mental integrity as does every child.&nbsp; Anything that endangers that
 sense of safety should not be tolerated.&nbsp; Transgender children 
have a suicide risk of 2.5 times greater than the norm.&nbsp; 
(Price-Feeney, Myeshia et al. "Understanding the Mental Health of 
Transgender and Nonbinary Youth" Journal of Adolescent Health, vol. 66, 
Issue 6, June 1, 2020. <a rel="nofollow" x="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2019.11.314">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2019.11.314</a>)
 Therefore, teachers should not be compelled to tell parents if their 
child is transgender.&nbsp; Everyone should respect the pronouns that a 
person chooses for themselves.&nbsp; A fundamental part of our common 
humanity is our ability to say who we are.&nbsp; Ensuring that people 
can do that safely no matter what their age is not granting them special
 rights but affirming their equal rights.</p>

<p>Until you can guarantee that parents aren't going to harm, disown, or
 otherwise create a dangerous living environment for LGBTQ children 
there will be blood on your hands. Youngkin's generation will die out 
and we will plant flowers over your graves that bring hope to the 
future. Disgusting, selfish generation can't die fast enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>People should be free to be happy, to be free to be loved, to be free
 to be who they are. Limiting people to live a life they can't stand 
will do nothing but harm everyone. The harmless act of being yourself 
shouldn't be punished no. It just doesn't make any sense.</p>

<p>This guidance is heartless and cruel. Every student should feel safe 
at school and this guidance puts trans and nonbinary students at risk. 
As a member of the LGBTQ community, I know the important role schools 
serve as a safe environment for LGBTQ youth. If enacted, this guidance 
would remove an important safety net for many LGBTQ youth.&nbsp;The VDOE
 must reject this guidance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Say NO to this discriminatory policy that singles out and 
discriminates agains trans students; such a policy will do great harm to
 those students at a most vulnerable period in their lives, and be an 
ugly lesson to all students who are trying to learn about good 
citizenship.</p>

<p>This regressive policy aimed at trans students is not about best 
practice for the students. This is about fulfilling a campaign promise 
that was grounded in fear and prejudice. Our students deserve better. 
They deserve policies that support their intellectual, physical, and 
emotional growth. They do not need or deserve policies that put them in 
harms way. If parents want total control of their children's educational
 experience, they have the choice and right to home school their 
children or send them to private schools. The government, schools, MUST 
create and follow policies that support ALL students, not the students 
of the radical and regressive few. This is bad for kids, this is a bad 
policy.</p>

<p>I deserve to be respected. Trans kids across Virginia deserve to be 
respected. If this law passes, we will see suicide rates go up, bullying
 and harassment go up, self harm go up, because you limit and rip away 
privacy, protection, and support for trans kids. You are actively 
hurting a vulnerable community. You should be ashamed of yourself.</p>

<p>This is disgusting discrimination. If you are not trans you have no 
right making laws for trans people and guess what, if your not trans, 
trans peoples pronouns have absolutely no effect on you. Grow up and 
move on with your life. Use tax money for something actually needed.</p>

<p>I am a young adult in Hampton Roads who attended public schools here.
 I did not have a safe and supportive environment to be myself at home. 
Teachers who loved, supported, and encouraged me to love myself no 
matter my identity were what kept me not only able to study and learn, 
but what kept me ALIVE. Trans youth deserve safety and respect. I 
attempted suicide at age 17; these guidelines are going to result in a 
huge increase in depressed and suicidal LGBT youth, and Virginia's teen 
suicide rate is already higher than the national average.</p>
<p>The science shows LGBT youth are at an increased risk of suicide, 
particularly Transgender youth as they are unwillingly dragged into the 
public eye to have their humanity debated. Meanwhile the same studies 
also show using Trans youth's chosen names and correct pronouns 
significantly lowers that suicide risk. Again, this policy is going to 
scar and kill children.</p>
<p>I have a lot of friends who are teachers, and if these guidelines 
pass they aren't going to follow them because they have no interest in 
harming their beloved students. Our state has a deeply concerning 
teacher shortage and this is going to exacerbate that as well.</p>

<p>Keep your hatred of those that are different out of schools. Trans 
kids have higher rates of bullying and suicide as is. They should be 
supported in schools. The US used to be celebrated for being a melting 
pot, but now it seems politicians are just trying to distract from real 
issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy is thinly veiled as a policy that addresses the topics 
and things, such as treatment of transgendered students with necessary, 
compassion, and respect for all students, and yet, functionally, it does
 just the opposite. This is a horrific step backwards, and I absolutely 
oppose withdrawing the 2001 model policies.</p>

<p>The proposed guidance is based on a fundamental and willful 
misunderstanding of what it means to be transgender. Being trans is not 
an ideology anymore than being cis is. I'm living proof: cisgender and 
opposed to this guidance, which as written, will only serve to cut off 
trans students from one of the dwindling number of public spaces that 
take steps to affirm their existence.</p>
<p>Many students cannot rely on their parents to provide a safe 
environment in which to navigate their gender identity, and if we are to
 continue with the assumption that schools are meant to serve every 
student, we cannot in good conscience blunt our schools' ability to 
actively assist a specific underserved demographic. Make no mistake: 
that is what this guidance is designed to do. It is hiding behind the 
anxieties of misinformed parents to normalize the erasure of transgender
 students.</p>

<p>Having thoroughly read the new model transgender policies, I find the
 governor's public statements in support of parent rights to be 
misleading at best. Parent rights are hampered under this new policy, by
 requiring them to provide additional evidence and documentation to have
 their wishes followed in school beyond what current policies require. 
This policy is simply making it more difficult for kids to transition 
socially, rather than involving parents more deeply. In addition, it 
allows greater freedom of speech to members of school staff if their 
views are in alignment with the governor, instead of allowing equal 
rights to all educators. Finally, despite lip service to providing safe 
and secure environment to all children, it is endangering the mental 
health and safety of some of our most vulnerable students.&nbsp; It is a
 terrible policy that should not be enforced in any school system.</p>

<p>Trans kids cannot help who they are. We as adults need to be 
supporting them and uplifting them, not making their lives EVEN harder 
through petty bureaucracy and fascist lawmaking. These kids will end up 
killing themselves, and their blood is on the hands of Youngkin &amp; 
all of his supporters.&nbsp;</p>

<div>Parents “rights” are not more important than our children’s lives. 
This policy will hurt kids. Transgender students are already a 
population with high risk factors. The 2022 policy is not based on 
evidence or research. In fact, the evidence and research 
runs&nbsp;contrary&nbsp;to the 2022 policy:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% 
reported suicidality. School belongingness mitigates these risks and is a
 significant predictor variable for reducing suicidal ideation and 
attempts among transgender youth (Austin et al., 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transgender and nonbinary youth whose schools prevent them from using
 the restrooms/locker rooms that best matched their gender identities 
were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted, 26% for 
transgender males and&nbsp;149% for transgender females (Murchison et 
al., 2019).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted 
suicide in the past year. In fact, when pronouns are respected, 
transgender youth attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did 
not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project, 2020).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transgender adolescents experience significantly disproportionate 
levels of childhood abuse compared to cisgender adolescents and 
experience greater levels of homelessness as a result of being kicked 
out or abused (Thoma, 2021).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since this guidance will regulate names, nicknames, and pronouns, it 
begs the question if non trans students will be allowed to go by 
nicknames unless explicit permission is given by parent's that their 
child can go by that nickname.&nbsp; Must Bill go by William or Jon go 
by Jonathan?&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; This is clearly targetting trans 
children and unfortunately will hurt those whose parents already do not 
support them.&nbsp; It is shameful, unnecessary, and detrimental to 
those children.&nbsp; Believe people are who they say they are.&nbsp; If
 a child born as raised as a gender aliging with their birth sex would 
like to go by another gender, believe that there is something valid to 
that claim.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It shouldn't be a matter of asking permission.&nbsp; Would we ask 
parents of gay student to give permission that their children can be 
gay?&nbsp; Why not have checklist at the beginning of the school year 
each parent must fill out to specify who their children can date?&nbsp; 
If a heterosexual white student wants to date a black student, do they 
need their parent's permission?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trans students already face many hurdles in their day to day 
lives.&nbsp; This guidance would simply reaffirm to them that there is 
something wrong with them, and it is so grievously abnormal that they 
must get permission to be who they are.&nbsp; It's absolutely ridiculous
 that the government is wasting time, policing individuals just trying 
to live their lives.&nbsp; Why not spend time of housing, affordability,
 infrastructure, and leave trans children alone.&nbsp; Enacting this 
policy is foolish on many levels.&nbsp; I am strongly opposed and 
embarrassed this is even up for debate in 2022.</p>

<p>These proposed policies to “protect” parents and staff rights will 
directly impact our family and thousands of others. While our child 
feels safe enough to be themself at home, many children do not have the 
same support from their parents. Current school policies in VA have 
allowed schools to be a place where many queer/trans kids can feel safe 
to be themselves, be relaxed and ready to learn, and not suffer 
repercussions at home. Taking away that sanctuary will have direct 
negative social, emotional AND educational impacts on too many students,
 including students who are cisgender who will watch the impact thirst 
change have on their peers.</p>
<p>Under the current policy, we, as parents, were permitted to submit 
written instructions to the school to change our student’s name and 
gender on official school records, WITHOUT legal documentation. The new 
policy would require us to get a court order and legal name and gender 
change in order to maintain that. That is a process we would like to 
take when we are ready, not because the department of education requires
 it. What about our parent rights?!</p>
<p>I implore you to reject this new policy in Virginia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm a trans adult living in Virginia, and I know this policy will 
lead to more mental illness and deaths among trans children in Virginia.
 Having supportive adults reduces the risk of suicide, but this 
legislation keeps that out of reach for trans youth in unsupportive 
homes. I didn't transition until adulthood because of my unsupportive 
family, and in that time I had many many suicide attempts, and developed
 mental health issues that still plague me to this day. My friends who 
experienced familial support are, comparatively much healthier both 
physically and mentally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have read the draft policy and I am appalled. As there parent of a 
teen who is gender non-conforming I am distressed at how this policy 
might affect their ability to feel comfortable and safe in school. They 
have already said it is too hard to come out there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also run a group practice that provides therapy to trans teens. 
There is a huge incidence of depression and suicidality in trans teens 
and adults and that is worsened when they are not supported by the 
community around them. This policy will literally kill children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please do not enact this policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a teacher in Virginia, I will make it my personal mission to 
convince every teacher and school staff member in my school and across 
the state to ONLY address students by the official name that appears on 
my roll. The student named Thomas James will no longer be allowed to be 
addressed as TJ--because that is not the official name on his birth 
certificate. Nathaniel will not be Nate, and K'Shawn will not be K.</p>
<p>I will call the Governor's tip line every time the morning 
announcements or school newspaper celebrates Maddie's field hockey 
success. Her name is Madeline.</p>
<p>I will also flood parents' emails with requests to have the 
permission to respect their child's identity by calling them by 
nicknames that are NOT their official birth certificate names, and 
explain to them the process of filing the paperwork to accommodate that 
name change in the school setting.</p>
<p>I will tell them that it is a GOVERNMENT LAW.</p>
<p>I will spend every day doing that, while referring to students only in the third person in order to avoid gendered pronouns.</p>

<p>Do not do this.&nbsp; If you fully understood the heightened suicide 
risk of LGBTQIA youth, and trans youth especially, you would not promote
 this policy.&nbsp; It is lack of acceptance, forcing youth to live 
inauthentic lives, and demanding conformity to traditional norms that 
drives trans youth to suicide.&nbsp; This policy will lead to more dead 
children.&nbsp; This is an avoidable mistake.&nbsp; I urge you to 
reconsider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>OPPOSED - the proposed changes will endanger transgender students</strong>
        </div>
        <div style="clear: right">&nbsp;</div>

        
        <div class="divComment">
          




<p>This comment is in response to "2022 MODEL&nbsp;POLICIES ON 
THE&nbsp;PRIVACY, DIGNITY,&nbsp;AND RESPECT FOR&nbsp;ALL&nbsp;STUDENTS 
AND&nbsp;PARENTS IN&nbsp;VIRGINIA’S&nbsp;PUBLIC&nbsp;SCHOOLS."</p>
<p>As written, implementation of the guidelines will contribute to 
harassment and discrimination of transgender students, and will result 
in higher prevalences of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and 
behaviors. The guidance specifically allows for teachers and other 
school staff to engage in behavior that has been empirically shown to be
 harmful to transgender students, including "deadnaming" them and 
refusing to use their preferred pronouns.</p>
<p>Many students - regardless of gender identity - do not feel safe in 
their homes, and this is especially true for transgender students who 
are not fortunate enough to live in homes with family members who 
support them. For those students, schools often represent a place for 
safe self-expression. The proposed guidance would remove that safety, 
leaving them with no outlet for being themselves. In addition to 
formally educating the students of the Commonwealth, schools provide 
opportunities for social and emotional learning, and we all owe it to 
every student to continue to provide those opportunities in a safe and 
welcoming environment. Giving teachers - who signed up for the job to 
presumably help shepherd students through their childhood and 
adolescence with care and support - the leeway to impose their own 
personal anti-transgender ideology on students by refusing to 
acknowledge their identity is counter to the positive role that school 
should play in students' lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I conduct research on depression and suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
 The empirical evidence clearly indicates that, among transgender 
students, having supportive teachers and schools can lead to reduced 
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidality; it can also lead to 
lower levels of substance use. Also, having supporting adult role models
 who respect transgender students' pronouns and name preferences sets 
the standard for students' peers, making them less likely to engage in 
bullying of transgender students.</p>
<p>In contrast, the discriminatory behavior that will be enabled by the 
proposed guidance is likely to increase bullying by peers, because the 
teachers themselves will be able to engage in bullying! By stifling 
students' free expression of their identity, members of the school 
system who disregard name and pronoun preferences will directly 
contribute to negative mental health outcomes among these students. The 
guidelines will subject transgender students to the anguish that attends
 being forced to use bathrooms inconsistent with their identity - 
imagine being a 14-year-old transgender girl who is forced to use the 
men's bathroom with 18-year-old male students! Furthermore, the 
provision that single-use bathroom be available is a pie-in-the-sky 
idea: Given how little this administration cares about providing 
resources for schools in general, coupled with Youngkin's clear 
antipathy toward transgender students, the notion that there would be 
sufficient funds made available for schools to install these new 
bathroom is ridiculous. There are schools in the Richmond Public School 
system that don't have enough money for paper - do you think they can 
afford to install a new bathroom?</p>
<p>These new guidelines are written in such bad faith. It's framed as 
being a "parents' rights" policy, but even in cases where parents are 
supportive of their transgender children, the new guidance would make it
 possible for teachers to discriminate against transgender kids. The 
text is clearly all written to make things more difficult for 
transgender students and their supportive parents, while making it 
easier for hateful anti-trans teachers and school staff to bully 
students and refuse to acknowledge their identity.</p>
<p>This is so disappointing and so transparent. If implemented, please 
know that everyone who makes these policies a reality will be 
responsible for the negative mental health outcomes - including suicidal
 behavior among trans students - that ensue.</p>

<p>I firmly oppose this 2022 guidance in all respects, because it 
institutionalizes an ideology that opposes the civic rights of 
transgendered people and would allow, even encourage, genuine cruelty by
 school teachers, principals, and administrators to such students and 
their families. Furthermore, it would foster and institutionalize 
prejudice against children and their families who do not conform to the 
rigid (and unspecified Christian sectarian) policies proposed by this 
guidance. As a long-time Charlottesville resident, I say that whoever 
wrote this guidance should be ashamed.</p>

<p>This will lead to the abuse of trans children and their further 
ostracizing amongst peers and staff at a time when children need the 
most support. School is for learning, not for the policing of a 
student’s gender expression to win political points. You will turn 
teachers, counselors, support staff and administrators into an unwilling
 gestapo, a band of reluctant informers who no trans children can turn 
to as a confidante the way all of their other schoolmates are able to 
do. As an educator I would resign before I would be forced to shame my 
students for their gender expression and possibly cause them great harm 
by outing them against their will. The blood of children will be on your
 hands and I am many other educators and staff will never be a part of 
it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly and whole-heartedly disagree with the policies set forth 
in regards to our gay and transgender students. This policy is 
essentially forcing schools, staff, coaches and admin to out students 
who do not feel safe or affirmed in their homes. These students are not 
the property of their parents. They are living, breathing human beings 
with rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution. Their rights do not 
end at the schoolhouse doors. These students deserve a quality education
 and a safe environment to learn free from discrimination. I am a parent
 of an LGBTQ student. Fortunately for him, he has a loving and affirming
 family surrounding him where he did feel safe, but he still chose when 
HE was ready to confide in me and his father. I am aware some of his 
friends do not have that luxury. If a child does not feel safe coming 
out to their parents, that burden to bear is on the parents. It is not 
the job of the school system to notify a parent of a student's change in
 name, pronouns, gender or sex. Do not force our public schools to put 
our most vulnerable students in harms way for the sake of politics and 
religion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I oppose the guidance. The mere idea that it will improve children's 
lives to allow others to harass, bully, intimidate, and traumatize them 
is asinine. They don't hurt anyone, but they're surrounded by people who
 want to hurt them mentally and physically. The VDOE should support the <em>students</em>
 more than anyone else. School should be a place children want to go, 
where they can feel supported, and they won't want to go somewhere 
that's encouraged to harm them.</p>

<p>This model has its priorities incredibly backwards. Children aren't 
just property of their parents, they're their own human beings. By 
requiring parent's permission for the correct pronouns to be used, 
you're robbing thousands of students the only chance they'll get at 
validation for the first 18 years of their life. Many students don't 
have the luxury of supportive parents, and school is the only chance 
they get to live as their true selves.</p>
<p>Governor Youngkin, imagine if you needed a parent's permission to be 
called a boy. What would that do to you mentally? Suicide is already the
 leading cause of death in people aged 10 to 24 (Hedegaard, Curtin, 
&amp; Warner, 2018), and when the person is LGBTQ+ with unsupportive 
family, they are 4 times more likely to attempt suicide (Johns et al., 
2019; Johns et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Remember; The people of Virginia includes the children of Virginia, 
and this model explicitly endangers countless transgender kids who just 
want to live their life with support from teachers and peers. Parents 
aren't in any danger if their kids are using different pronouns at 
school than at home, but their children will be at a much higher risk of
 suicide if you take away the one place they can be themselves if their 
home isn't safe.</p>

<p>Any and all actions that force a child to out themselves is 
dangerous. Protecting trans childrens’ rights to their names, pronouns, 
and how they identify is not only the bare minimum when it comes to 
respecting human beings and their autonomy, but it is suicide 
prevention.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy will result in measurable harms to an already 
marginalized community. Studies have repeatedly shown that 
gender-affirming policies reduce suicides and improve quality of life 
for trans kids. Policies like this will also increase bullying of trans 
kids.</p>

          <strong>These proposed policies enshrine treating students poorly and should not be implemented</strong>
        </div>
        <div style="clear: right">&nbsp;</div>

        
        <div class="divComment">
          




<p>These proposed policies (2022 Model Policies on the privacy, dignity,
 and respect for all students and parents in Virginia's public schools) 
are lousy and predicated on several poor assumptions. They use 
disingenuous language to enshrine bad choices and completely ignore the 
reality of marginalized populations and what their family lives are 
often like, all in the service of letting adults who should know better 
to treat them as less than their fellow students.</p>
<p>The claim that this is somehow necessary in order to align with the 
statement that a “parent has a fundamental right to make decisions 
concerning the upbringing, education, and care of the parent’s child” is
 a deliberately obtuse reading. A parent absolutely has "a fundamental 
right to make decisions concerning" their child. This in no way requires
 that a parent be involved in making&nbsp;<strong>every</strong> decision regarding their child, and our schools would crumble if this policy was actually implemented across the board.</p>
<p>We would laugh out loud at the idea that it would be necessary to get
 a parent's explicit permission to use whatever "name [or] nickname" a 
child might request. I would comfortably bet that a teacher has sent 
home a form requesting permission to call their student, named 
"Elisabeth," by the name of "Peggy" or "Liz" exactly zero times in the 
history of the Commonwealth. At the age of fifty-two I have had exactly 
zero authority figures argue with my request to be called "Don" rather 
than my legal name of "Donald." Not one teacher has ever refused because
 it's not the name on my birth certificate.</p>
<p>I would also wager that no student who commonly goes by their middle 
name rather than their first name has ever been asked to provide 
parental permission. I believe without reservation that the Skips and 
Trips and Juniors walk free through school halls. Unless all of these 
situations are now going to require paperwork it seems clear that this 
claim that parents must be involved in these decisions is a fig leaf for
 enabling the targeting of a specific group of people.</p>
<p>Similarly this claim that the engaging of common courtesy - 
addressing people by the name they request, rather than insisting that a
 birth certificate is somehow sacrosanct - is too much to ask of our 
civil servants is ridiculous. I doubt a person would last one minute in 
Jeff Goettman's office if they insisted they must only address him as 
Jeffery. <a rel="nofollow" x="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/cabinet/name-917815-en.html#:~:text=Jeff%20Goettman%20serves%20as%20the,the%20Stanford%20School%20of%20Business.">It certainly seems like it's okay for official publications.</a>
 So please spare me the claim that asking that same basic courtesy for 
our transgendered youth is too much. Anyone who finds the application of
 manners towards the students entrusted into the state's care to be too 
great a lift should find other employment, assuming they can find 
somewhere that would employ someone who won't address a person with 
basic respect.</p>
<p>More briefly: the claim in II. C that this act will be implemented so
 that "no student is discriminated against or harassed on the basis of 
his or her sex" is simply incompatible with the ridiculous assertion in 
in V. C. that "compelling others to use preferred pronouns" is a First 
Amendment violation. Any number of other basic human behaviours could be
 thrown out with this ridiculous claim. Many kinds of racist behaviour 
could be excused by this. None of it belongs in our schools. People who 
cannot muster up this common courtesy because of their own gender 
bigotry should seek other employment and not be sheltered by State 
policy.</p>
<p>These kids come into schools with the expectation of basic courtesy 
and respect and they are even legally compelled to do so. To then refuse
 to grant them basic courtesy and autonomy over their own identities is 
abhorrent.</p>

<p>Its astonishing how belligerent adults are once they find success 
themselves and separate their humanity from once ebing a child. So much 
so that the tradition of making kids unhappy with the things they 
discover about themselves continues in the modern day.</p>

<p>My youngest daughter just started middle school, and she should not 
be forced to be “fully exposed” to transgender demands or policies that 
violate her God given rights. Why should her rights be violated in 
bathrooms or locker rooms by way of allowing biologically born males in 
the same place at the same time? &nbsp;Neither should they see her 
undressed, nor should she be forced to see them undressed. (The first 
time it happens, we are going to have a problem). &nbsp;Her rights as an
 innocent child should be protected and promoted by way of limiting her 
exposure and forced participation in gender dysphoria. 
&nbsp;Furthermore, the promotion of gender dysphoria behind the backs of
 parents is an absolute affront to parental rights. If children are 
confused about their gender, that is something their parents should be 
directly involved in and have full oversight over. Our children are not 
wards of the state. It’s sad that grown adults are peddling falsehoods 
to influence our children behind our backs…secretly and covertly, and 
without our express approval are willing participation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The document currently in effect specifies that transgender children 
are at a drastically increased risk of homelessness due to abusive 
families. Therefore, school personnel are to treat a child's gender 
identity as private information, even from the child's parents. The 
proposed new document reverses this, and actively encourages teachers to
 tell parents about their children's gender identity. This will result 
in more children being abused and abandoned by their families, which 
will lead to more children dying of starvation, exposure, or suicide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone who votes in favor of this proposal is voting in favor of 
killing children. The least you could do is be honest about that, 
instead of lying about wanting to protect them.</p>

<p>As an educator, I strongly oppose the proposed guidance. These 
measures are unnecessary and cruel. Children cannot learn when they feel
 afraid -- it's really as simple as that. No child should have to fear 
their teacher betraying them. Educators need the freedom to support 
their students as these young people are discovering who they are and 
how they want to live their lives.</p>

<p>Transgender children should have the freedom to explore their gender 
as they see fit, even while young. It is the responsibility of those 
around them to be accommodating and respectful of these freedoms 
&nbsp;or else risk doing real mental damage to them. To this extent, it 
is imperative that transgender students be able to request a preferred 
name and pronouns that differ from their biological sex. It is also 
imperative that they be allowed to use the same bathrooms as others of 
the gender they identify with. This proposed policy will ostracize trans
 gender children and is explicitly not respectful &nbsp;of transgender 
children’s needs and panders to the unfounded feelings of cisgender 
people and parents. Trans kids deserve protections at school &nbsp;that 
allow them to be their whole selves without being outed or ostracized 
&nbsp;by their teachers and peers. Disallowing preferred pronouns and 
names will lead to outing and ostracizing of trans kids; this goes 
against the stated purpose of this document. Talk to some trans people 
about treating trans people respectfully prior to making policy around 
them.</p>

<p>The forced outing of trans and non binary kids to parents is an 
action that can only end badly. This runs the serious and real risk of 
an abusive parent harming their child or worse due to their gender 
identity, if this goes through there will be blood on your 
administrations hands, if you even care that is.</p>
<p>You people sicken me, there’s a special place in hell for those who 
use children to further their political ambitions, May none of you ever 
serve in office again&nbsp;</p>

<p>This document is written through a guise of hate and ignorance.&nbsp;
 Children have a natural right to figure out their own identity, express
 it how they wish, and to have that identity treated as valid by their 
community and those that love and care for them.&nbsp; But many parents 
don't understand that yet and believe they should be able to dictate how
 their children feel.&nbsp; These children need to be guaranteed privacy
 and protection from those that would harm them should they be outed by 
their school.&nbsp; It is the job of a school to educate and protect the
 children that go there.&nbsp; Outing a child to a potentially abusive 
parent is not protecting them.&nbsp; It is a dereliction of duty.&nbsp; 
"Parent's rights" are just a smokescreen that fascists and religious 
extremists hide behind, using the most vulnerable as political 
footballs.&nbsp; Do not enact this terrible guidance.&nbsp; Protect 
trans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming children from ANYONE who 
would do them harm - even if that is their own ignorant, misguided 
families.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">As a student and resident of Virginia I 
strongly oppose. My family and I came here to escape the political 
ideals of republicans. However the past election brought Youngkin here. I
 have had no sense inclusivity of from him and his ideas therefore I do 
not welcome him. Yet he still has the audacity to force his policies and
 his ideals on us. No way shape or form does he show that we can be 
different and happy. Many children including myself have to grow up upon
 the idea that there is only one way to be truly happy. A white, 
cisgender, straight, rich, christian man. However I am very different 
from that. I am a someone who doesn't identify with man nor woman, I am 
attracted to more than one gender, I am not financially stable, and I am
 atheist. I am tired of being silenced just because of that. I have a 
voice and I sure as hell will use it. Politicians have no right with my 
identity. I dream of a world where I have more rights than a gun.</p>

<p>Once one person's privacy is called into question, ANYONE'S privacy 
could be called into question. Do you really want all of your dirty 
laundry aired out publicly, legally? It is not a coincidence that the 
ghouls of the republican party always target the most vulnerable among 
us: Trans Children. Protecting Trans Futures is imperative, and the best
 way to start would be to keep Glenn Youngkin out of our schools. As 
co-CEO of the Carlyle Group (primary shareholders of Accelerate 
Learning, the "personalized online learning" curriculum) Youngkin only 
wants to set himself up to profit heavily from the way we structure our 
schools in VA. Virginians do not accept you lining your pockets with 
Trans Lives glenn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a horrible backwards step in policy that, if enacted, will 
surely make life incredibly unsafe for many children in Virginia. Please
 allow people to be themselves and stop these cruel and hurtful 
policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly &nbsp;oppose the new model policies for Virginia schools. 
This is a step backwards to a harsher, more violent time. Studies have 
shown again and again that honoring the name and identity of transgender
 youth is measurable suicide prevention. These policies are not evidence
 based, as they are mandated to be, and so should be ineligible for 
presentation or adoption. Trans students are not dominating tournaments 
or harming the opportunities or their cis peers. Trans students are not a
 threat to student safety, yet they do face bullying and violence 
themselves. These policies could out students in unsafe living 
environments, adding dangers to them not only within the school grounds,
 but at home as well. The cynical culture wars this administration are 
engaging in for their own political gain, will lead to very real harm, 
harm against some of those most vulnerable in society at large. It is 
leveraging the pain and humiliation of children for power, and it is 
unquestionably wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a parent in Virginia, I strongly support the Privacy, Dignity and 
Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools model 
policies. These affirm and protect the rights of every public school 
student in the Commonwealth. I'm grateful for the commitment Governor 
Youngkin made to restore excellence in education and the promises he's 
keeping to parents, children, teachers and all Virginians in his first 
year in office.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I believe that this policy is for ghouls in human flesh to carry out

like them and want everyone to be as natu and terrible as their pathetic
 selves. Trans people are fine, leave schools and parents alone.</p>

<p>The idea of denying transgender students' identities or denying them 
human rights is abuse and is shameful. When they tell you who they are, 
believe them, respect them, and protect their ability to feel safe. 
Don't let your own feelings cause you to try to force yourself on them.</p>

<p>I oppose Governor Youngkin's policy on transgender youth. Our young

 this will endanger trans youth and single them out for discrimination.</p>

<p>Strongly opposed to these proposed policies—requiring trans students 
to get parental permission is dangerous and invites the possibility for 
extreme familial abuse. We all know a kid from high school who came from
 a “bad home,” who had to protect themselves from 
physical/mental/emotional/etc. abuse!! Trans kids don’t owe anyone 
anything. Let them grow up to be healthy trans adults in charge or their
 own destiny! These proposed policies are a gross violation of rights on
 behalf of students everywhere.</p>

<p>Children accept others as they find them. They learn to hate if we 
adults teach it to them. Children questioning their gender identity have
 enough to deal with &nbsp; Don’t pile on adult prejudice to their 
problems. Our job as adults is to support and help children understand 
their true and authentic selves. And learn to live in the world they 
will encounter as an adult. &nbsp;We can do that with empathy and 
understanding and allowances for all they are trying to sort out about 
themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whose liberties and rights really need protection here?&nbsp; Not the
 bad old mainstream's.&nbsp; The 2021 policy was a welcome step in the 
right direction.&nbsp; Rescinding it will immiserate an already deeply 
marginalized population of trans students (and insult their 
parents).&nbsp; The proposed move will also ill serve the straight kids 
in the class, who must learn, not only to deal with sexual dissidence, 
but to accept it and practice the arts of friendship and support that 
our society at large so desperately needs to cultivate.</p>

<p>It's hard enough for these kids, why make it more difficult.&nbsp; 
Might as well have them wear a scarlet "T" for transgender, because 
that's what the governor is doing with this policy.</p>

<p>I can't imagine how cruel &amp; corrupt an organization has to become to even think that any of this <img src="VirginiaRegulatoryTownHallViewComments1_files/blackbox.gif" alt="black box" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: middle">
 is ok. Without self-determination, no one if free. Leave gay people, 
trans, bi, &amp; all other queer folk alone. Stop banning books, stop 
trying to tell people what to wear or whom to live, just stop all of 
this discriminatory, predatory nonsense. Just effing stop. We won't 
tolerate these repressive policies any longer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The policies that Youngkin sets forth to implement against LGBTQ 
students is a violation of human rights, and is a threat against the 
livelihood of these children. Outing a student for being Gay, Bi, Trans,
 Nonbinary. etc opens up the student for the possibility of physical 
violence, as well as various forms of assault and discriminatory 
practices. These students have the right to live life how they wish 
without having to worry for their safety and without dealing with the 
trauma involved with public scrutiny and violence by those that object.</p>

<p>If a kid wants to test out going by a different name or trying out a 
different haircut, what harm does that cause society at large?&nbsp; We 
are focusing too much on what parents want their kids to be and not 
enough on how their kids feel. If the parents won't support them at 
home, the kid should be able to at least have some reprieve from their 
control at school where they can be themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trans people have a hard enough time as-is without all this effort 
being spent on attacking them by a national political party. There are 
many other issues that need attention that could actually do some good 
for Virginia, but instead these new guidelines are focused on bullying 
some LGBTQ kids for clout.</p>
<p>Keep the old guidelines, they were fine. These new ones will only cause harm to kids.</p>

<p>I don’t think this law is actually informed about transgender 
identities or children. It is gravely misinformed and will get children 
abused or worse if outed to their parents. It will also cause adverse 
mental health in the children themselves. If you actually cared about 
children you should not pass this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model policies targeting trans students will make school a less 
safe place for many students. I recognize that parents want to know what
 is happening with their children, but students also want and need to be
 comfortable and accepted at school. Turning teachers and other students
 into informers will create conflicts that will ultimately make school a
 stressful environment for many students.</p>

<p>This policy will kill children.&nbsp; Statistics show that 86% of 
trans children contemplate suicide, and 56% of them will attempt to take
 their own lives.&nbsp; With support, that number drops to 4%.&nbsp; I 
have personally had more students than I can count tell me that they are
 not safe at home in their identities.&nbsp; Children are people and it 
is vital that we take their needs--what THEY state as their needs, not 
their parents--into account when ensuring our schools are safe havens.</p>

<p>I support your his reboot. I feel like the previous document 
supported &amp; promoted one group over all others. As an educator it 
put me in a very tenuous position between some children &amp; their 
parents’ rights. I do not feel as a teacher that it is appropriate for 
me to step in between a teenager &amp; their parents. When individual 
situations of that kind come up social services should handle that 
outside of the classroom &amp; school.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every part of this change is solely to make the lives of children 
harder. Not only will this demonize trans kids, but it will also lead to
 cis/trans children alike being sexually inspected for nothing more than
 assumptions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Children are people; they possess thoughts and feelings and control 
over their own actions. Though, as adults, we often limit the expression
 of these things for a variety of reasons; so much of our kids' lives 
are already so thoroughly regimented and controlled by the world they 
live in. Why do we punish them for asking for respect and autonomy 
concerning matters of personal expression/autonomy that do not&nbsp; 
inherently hurt themselves nor others?</p>
<p>Being openly transgender and/or gender non-conforming involves a 
person offering a certain amount of trust and vulnerability to those 
around them. I am sad to see actions that do not recognize, or, 
recognize and reject, the opportunity to help and protect these people 
-- these children.</p>
<p>How we treat people systemically influences how individuals view and 
treat groups, as well as how people view and treat themselves. Being 
trans is not inherently a spectacle or shock (certainly not for the 
people who have lived with themselves their whole life); it's our choice
 to turn it into one. So far, this reaction of treating transness as 
unusual and unprecedented has bred an environment of intense scrutiny 
surrounding gender expression, appearance, and interests. This not only 
hurts trans people, it hurts everyone.</p>
<p>Even if you fear and do not understand transness, you likely 
understand that forcing children into prescribed ways of living, 
thinking, playing, and, dressing, and enjoying based solely on gender is
 a bit silly. What about being a girl inherently means you can't or 
shouldn't like traditionally "boy" things, e.g. playing with toy cars, 
or, being a doctor? What about being a boy inherently means you can't or
 shouldn't like traditionally "girl" things, e.g. wearing pink, or, 
styling hair? Gender roles, expectations, and presentation change 
constantly and consistently throughout time and place.</p>
<p>Why do we feel the need to hurt and alienate children -- people -- in
 order to avoid listening to those we might not immediately understand? 
Transgender kids will not stop being trans due to being ignored and 
mistreated, they will only stop feeling safe enough to be open about 
their existence. When trans kids cease to exist under these sorts of 
systems, it's generally due to harm inflicted by self, others, and/or 
the environment they live in.</p>
<p>In summary, I would like for kids to grow up in a world that's safe; 
where they can be honest and respected without hurting themselves for 
others. When we foster an environment where kids feel confident in their
 autonomy and ability to express themselves, then we as adults can more 
easily and effectively help them if and when children encounter 
difficulty. Kids are not our enemies, they are people learning how to 
function in the world we've created and maintain. Do we want kids to 
grow up being told, implicitly or explicitly, that they deserve respect,
 basic hygienic facilities, to be heard -- to live -- only when they 
pretend to be what adults say they must be?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reconsider.</p>

<p>This is a terrible policy decision that comes from hate and fear of 
issues that do not actually exist. Our schools are the best in the 
nation for a reason and allowing this gibberish will destroy the 
educational process. If parents don’t like that their children are 
learning actual facts then they can homeschool them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All children deserve protection. This includes transgender students. 
Many students come from households where their safety would be at risk 
if their families knew they were trans.</p>

<p>As a Virginia native, I am usually proud of my birthplace and 
upbringing. However, I am thoroughly ashamed of this proposal. If the 
aim is to harm children, this proposal is a success. Supporting the 
rights of transgender children is lifesaving; this has been shown time 
and again in multiple, rigorous, longitudinal studies.</p>
<p>If this policy is adopted, children will come to extreme harm. Do not adopt this policy, for the sake of our children.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking this action to protect the constitutional rights
 of parents. My family is increasingly bewildered as to the direction 
that Virginia's public schools are taking, and whether that is a 
direction we want our child to go when she is old enough to be educated.
 Families should be in charge of Virginia's schools, not far left 
ideologues.</p>

          <strong>Strongly support proposed 2022 Model Policies (Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for all students/paren </strong>

        <div class="divComment">
          




<p>I strongly support the 2022 Model Policies on the ‘The Privacy, 
Dignity, and Respect for all Students and Parents in Virginia’s Public 
Schools,’ and am grateful for the responsiveness of Gov Youngkin and the
 VDOE in their efforts of rescinding and replacing the radical and 
potentially dangerous 2021 Model Policies for the Treatment of 
Transgender Students in Public Elementary and Secondary Schools under 
Gov Northam. This rewritten 2022 policy safeguards and restores parental
 rights and values in the upbringing and education of their 
children.&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution 
guarantees religious freedom and prohibits the government from 
compelling speech that is contrary to an individual’s personal or 
religious beliefs, such as the forced use of ‘gender identity’ pronouns.
 Moreover, the 14th Amendment in our Constitution gives parents a 
"fundamental right to direct the upbringing and education of their 
children."</p>
<p>Under the previous 2021 Model Policies for the Treatment of 
Transgender Students Gov Northam 'disregarded the rights of parents' and
 also "promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and 
social transformation in schools” aka ‘indoctrination and social 
engineering.’ The previous policy usurped parental authority and gave 
new meaning to ‘Right to Privacy’ —meaning the school/teachers protected
 student ‘privacy’ and withheld minors’ transgender transitions, gender 
identities and sexual orientation from their parents/legal guardians 
UNLESS they had the students’ permission to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;The former
 policy also gave males with gender dysphoria access to bathrooms and 
other areas where females disrobe, and overnight travel accommodations 
for school trips, thus violating the females’&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" x="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/1557-final-rule.pdf">right to privacy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This
 same restroom policy was in place at the Loudoun County (Virginia) 
Public Schools, which reportedly covered up a 15-year-old girl 
being&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" x="https://www.dailywire.com/news/breaking-loudoun-rapist-sentenced-put-on-sex-offender-registry-for-life">raped</a>&nbsp;and
 sodomized in a stall by a teenage boy wearing a skirt. This same 
teenage boy was transferred to another public school where he attacked 
another female student.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This revised 2022 policy will keep biological boys out of the Girls 
Public School Bathrooms and other designated female areas with 
provisions for a separate space for transgenders to 
use.&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia's Department of Education states that the word 
"sex" means biological sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;The policies also define 
"transgender student" as "a public school student whose parent has 
requested in writing, due to their child’s persistent and sincere belief
 that his or her gender differs with his or her sex, that their child be
 so identified while at school."&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a common sense 
policy that ensures ALL students are treated with dignity and respect 
and provides positive and safe learning environments for ALL 
students.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a huge step in a positive direction for 
families and students.</p>

<p>I oppose this proposal. As a parent, I want to know that my child 
will always be safe and supported at school. This policy would do the 
opposite of that, preventing teachers from supporting trans and 
nonbinary kids and putting them in harms way. This is not the Virginia I
 want to raise my child in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am strongly opposed to the se proposed changes. When transgender 
kids have their gender validated, they are more happy and less likely to
 attempt suicide. This change is inly hurting people who are already 
vulnerable.</p>

<p>I strongly support this change. Parents should never be left out of 
decisions that impact their child. Schools do not have equal or more 
authority over children's lives than their parents. This is a 
commonsense measure and I applaud Governor Youngkin for keeping his 
campaign promise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this sad, backward suggestion. I think to say it’s a
 freedom of speech issue for the opposing person is completely 
backwards, and that it’s also extremely confusing in wording even for 
cisgendered kids. So if Samantha who was born a girl and identifies as 
one wants to go by Sam, are you going to tell her she isn’t allowed to? 
Massive overstep into someone’s personal identity.</p>

<p>These model policies are rooted in transphobia and only seek to further harm trans and non-binary kids.</p>
<p>As we <strong>all</strong> know in 2021, Governor Ralph Northam 
signed the Virginia Values Act into law after it was passed through the 
General Assembly. This law sweepingly, effectively prohibited 
discrimination in public and private employment, credit, housing, and 
public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation and gender 
identity, among other additional protected categories. The protections 
in this act have been extended to protect LGBTQ+ youth in Virginia 
public schools throughout the Commonwealth to prohibit discrimination, 
harassment, and violence in against these students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governor Youngkin's proposed policies <em><strong>explicitly contradict state law and are illegal.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

<p>Children cannot be excluded from the realistic troubles of the world 
if they have to worry about having their identities constantly seized 
and attacked. The obsession with our children's bodies on behalf of our 
lawmakers is not only alarming but counterproductive and tasteless. The 
attempt to make America a fascist government on any level should not 
stand.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Forcing citizens to experience gender dysphoria is bad public policy</strong>

<p>I don’t understand what possible rationale (other than theocratic 
bigotry) that you have for insisting on a public policy against 
healthcare. &nbsp;Gender reaffirming healthcare has clinically proven to
 prevent gender dysphoria and reduce risk of suicide. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly you either prefer trans kids to commit suicide or hate 
supportive families. &nbsp;Please don’t persecute trans citizens or 
their families. &nbsp; it’s not too late to not be horrible!</p>

<p>Schools should be a safe space for all children.&nbsp; Yes, parents 
should be involved with their children, but unfortunately not all 
parents are supportive of their own children's choices.&nbsp; Forcing 
the schools to follow one ideology based on fear is ridiculous and will 
ultimately harm children.&nbsp; We should be looking for ways to make 
schools safer and supporting our kids, not forcing them to be someone 
they aren't because of a minority opinion.&nbsp; Love everyone as they 
are and want to be and give them the support that they need.&nbsp; This 
is just wasting time on the stupid culture wars instead of actually 
trying to make schools better for our kids.</p>

<p>We must show love and kindness to all whom we encounter. This is the 
only way to achieve common good, peace, and prosperity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, policies such as this only serve to stoke hate, fear, 
and malice. There is no good in permitting vitriolic speech towards 
ANYONE, regardless of their gender-identity, race, creed, or any 
characteristic.</p>
<p>It is sad to me that some of our public servants, and some of our 
fellow citizens, would support spewing such animosity and anger towards 
anyone, let alone children.</p>

<p>As a matter of policy, public schools must support and accept all 
students and provide an environment where they can learn and grow, 
limited only by their own abilities and interests. The "guidance" in 
this proposal separates, denigrates, and devalues trans kids, the exact 
opposite of what they need. Depression, suicide, and homelessness are 
higher among trans kids than their cis peers; misguided policies such as
 this will do nothing to improve that situation.</p>
<p>If you are considering suicide or are otherwise in crisis, help is available by calling 988.</p>

<p>These proposed policies are a major step backwards in promoting 
school environments where all students are safe to learn and grow. 
School years are so foundational in an individual's sense of self, 
confidence, and safety in their own skin, and we need to prioritize 
policies that allow students to be advocates for themselves, regardless 
of what their parents believe.</p>

<p>The new transgender student policy is harmful, at best. At worst, it 
could be deadly for trans kids who don’t have a space where they can be 
themselves without jumping through hoops and dealing with red tape. 
Schools are supposed to be a safe place for kids to be loved and 
respected for who they are, and this policy goes directly against that 
baseline goal. <br>I believe that the only point of introducing this 
policy is to enrage the opposing political party, and that amounts to 
using the lives of kids as pawns in a political argument. No actual good
 comes from this policy - only bad; therefore it should be eliminated.</p>

<p>I oppose this draft document in the strongest possible terms. Even if
 you leave aside the cruel way these proposed policies target any 
children who may be questioning their gender identities (and you 
shouldn’t leave that aside), this is a piece of education guidance that 
will only worsen the quality of education for Virginia children. When 
you create a policy that singles out and stigmatizes children for their 
differences, the only thing they will be able to focus on is their 
safety, NOT their education. When these kids should be spending their 
school years focused on learning, figuring out who they are and gaining 
new experiences, they will spend their entire day looking over their 
shoulders and wondering if they will have to face state-sanctioned 
discrimination. As someone who was bullied as a kid, I know the psychic 
toll that being singled out for your differences can have at a young 
age. This is an experience that no child should be forced to go through,
 and knowing that these policies will foster even worse experiences for 
children, forcing them to be singled out not just by their peers but by 
their teachers (who should be protecting them) and a society that is 
fearful of what they represent, is a devastating reality to confront. 
And for those who think that these policies will only ever affect the 
“different” kids that you are so afraid of, recognize that every single 
kid who will be stigmatized by these policies has friends who will worry
 over the well-being of their buddy, or teachers who won’t be able to 
provide the best instruction possible out of fear of retaliation or 
inadvertently doing damage to a student, or parents who will suffer at 
work and at home because of what their kid is going through at school. 
The ripple effects from this legislation will be massive and 
devastating, and the damage done to those affected will last a lifetime.
 I recommend that the Virginia Department of Education scrap this entire
 proposed document and re-write their guidance to actually focus on 
increasing the quality of education in our state, instead of worsening 
it for all but the most hateful and vindictive adults in the seats of 
power.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the implementation of this guidance.&nbsp; Its 
creation is a thinly veiled attempt by a particular political group to 
appease the lowest common denominator rather than actually benefit the 
students of our Commonwealth.&nbsp; Instead, it harms children by 
forcing their journey towards understanding, accepting, and loving 
themselves to be much harder than is even remotely necessary.</p>

<p>Young people who identify as non-binary and trans, as well as members
 of the LGBTQIA community, suffer isolation and depression at higher 
rates and face bullying and emotional distress in school settings at 
higher rates than most students. Teachers are among the many positive 
and supportive adult role models our children need - they need tools and
 support and hands NOT tied by the state - in order to support our 
non-binary and trans kids.&nbsp; In an era of epic teacher shortage, our
 teachers who are non-binary and trans need to feel safe and comfortable
 in their profession.</p>

<p>As an educator, I am opposed to this because it harms children. 
Students who are transitioning or who are afraid to are incredibly 
vulnerable.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose this guidance. My 13 year old son is in public 
school and knows trans kids at his school and to him it is no big deal. 
He has not been harmed in any way by the existing policies that our 
district follows that support trans youth. I have family and friends in 
the LGBTQ+ community and they need all the support they can get and we 
do not want to go backwards in supporting them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a gross overreach from a political party I grew up thinking 
was for a smaller, less intrusive gov't. Your religious freedom stops 
when it tramples on peoples rights, this applies to abortion, religion, 
gender, sexual orientation. Republicans have lost their mind since Trump
 was elected, they refuse to accept modern science, and refuse to 
acknowledge our history as a nation. This legislation is 
dangerous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been thinking about this and how I am going to say
 it since it dropped on 9/16/2022 about the Youngkin Administration’s 
education policies on how they treat LGBTQ+ kids and public educators. I
 could not standby and be silent about it. To say this, it is 
transphobic and bullying behavior of the Youngkin Administration to put 
policies like this, but it is not surprising because of how the 
Youngkins’s are as people, especially the fact that the governor and 
First Lady of Virginia are insecure and mean people that care about 
showing off how rich they are and will do anything to be popular and put
 money in their pocket books. Hate and Discrimination will and should 
not be tolerated anywhere, that includes a school setting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Even though I live next door in NC, here in NC while I 
was a freshman in college, NC in 2016 passed a bill called HB-2 that 
targeted trans people and let me tell you, it was embarrassing and also 
insulting towards the LGBTQ+ community and it made NC not an inclusive 
place at the time. Passing policies that discriminate the LGBTQ+ 
community like these examples are putting the lives of LGBTQ+ people and
 their families at risk and it’s not ok to do this anymore.&nbsp;It is 
not Christian to hate people that are different from you. It is not in 
good faith to hold an inaugural party at the time of when cases were 
high with no safety precautions towards covid that put an entire 
commonwealth and neighboring states at risk of getting 
sick.&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes to show how the Youngkin Family, in my opinion 
are unauthentic and selfish people that pretend to care about everyone 
but they do not care about anyone. For example, when Suzanne Youngkin in
 a video said that “she married a winner” with her kids laughing in the 
background on election night, I know who she bullied specifically that 
night and that and example of that shows that she was being insensitive 
and also shows her insecurities by her behavior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>When Glenn and his staff bullied a teenager in February, specifically
 his press secretary Macaulay Porter, his apology was not an apology at 
all. It wouldn’t surprise me if their four kids bullied anyone and I 
hope in writing this that if any of Glenn and Suzanne’s friends and 
family, including their kids friends and former classmates that do not 
agree with their behavior and have been questioning it for the last 
eight months, yet alone, not feel good about any of it, including this 
policy the Youngkin Administration put out on outing LGBTQ+ kids, I 
understand it is an awkward and hard position to be in, but honestly, it
 is time to speak up against their behavior because it is hurting so 
many people and it is all on you to do the right thing. The silence is 
unacceptable. For the entire LGBTQ+ community, I standby you and will be
 standing up alongside you because you deserve to be treated with 
respect and love, especially in school. Plus, please vote in the 
election if you do not agree with the policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shame on the Youngkin Administration</p>

<p>We can't allow ignorance and misguided trendy gender theories to 
force parents to pretend that biological sex doesn't exist. On top of 
that - what is transgender exactly? There is no medical test, no 
psychological test. There is no consistent legal standard such as in the
 UK (where they require a gender recognition certificate). If the only 
standard is "this boy now says she's a girl", then that's useless and 
unworkable for your typical public school. Even worse when kids claim to
 be "non binary" and change their identity from day to day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If this law goes through Trans suicide rates will go up by thousands.
 Many transgender kids have parents who aren’t supportive so when at 
school it is their safe space where they can feel appreciated and loved.
 If this is taken away from us we will have no safe space so we will 
resort to suicide. You are a retard if you agree with this law and if 
this goes through you do not care about the kids you only care about you
 and your selfish bias. Our governor has probably never had to work for 
anything in this world so he has no idea how rough it is to be different
 and have to go through injustice. Personally as a trans kid <img src="VirginiaRegulatoryTownHallViewComments1_files/blackbox.gif" alt="black box" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: middle"> You.</p>

<p>We need to protect ALL children in schools, not just the ones that 
"conform" to whatever society tells them they have to be. Revoking the 
2021 policy is cruel to trans kids and all kids. We need to be 
accepting, not divisive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The harm that comes from making a child be something they are not is 
life long. It makes no sense to go out of your way as a governor or 
school administrator to hurt children. We know who we are, no one has to
 look between their legs to know their identity. Outing Trans youth can 
have deadly consequences. After doing what you propose and they react 
feeling hopeless trapped and alone and decided to kill themselves you 
should be head responsible for their death. You want to do the right 
thing, not cause harm to a child. Stop this madness and allow kids to be
 themselves. They only person it seems to hurt is you, so I suggest you 
get help, counseling and come to terms with your need to harm children. 
Kids should be called by their name, allowed to express themselves, go 
to the bathroom in piece and allowed to participate in sports if they so
 desire. Think of the lawsuits and money you will expend taking on this 
perverse act of yours against children. If you have kids, I feel sorry 
for them and the legacy you will leave them as an abuser of children 
over an entire state. You are going to Trump your hate over their 
medical help and well being. When did you become smarter than doctors in
 objecting to their medical care? &nbsp;Stop the insanity before it’s 
too late and children are lost!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm so proud of our Governor for standing up for parents. They have 
every right to parent their children without government oversight by 
public schoolteachers who are so wrapped up in students' sexuality, the 
kids aren't even passing SOLs in many counties! Truly I never thought 
I'd write a sentence like that: gov't paid teachers want to talk about 
their STUDENTS' SEXUAL IDENTITY RATHER THAN CORE SUBJECTS. Stay in your 
lane and appreciate your gov't paycheck and summers off!!!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am writing to express my displeasure and strong disagreement with 
the current proposed changes to existing model policy for trans and 
non-binary students. This policy is targeting a marginalized group at 
their most vulnerable--in schools--and working on the false assumption 
that parents will always work in the best interest of their child with 
regards to trans and non binary issues. This policy allows for teachers 
and counselors to potentially become informants to parents regarding 
gender/trans issues and leave children with no confidential allies to 
seek support and guidance.&nbsp; Children are not guaranteed acceptance 
by their own parents if they are outed as trans or non-binary and in 
fact parental rejection likely contributes to the high rate of suicide 
and substance abuse that many trans and non binary people are prey to.</p>
<p>I am the mother of a trans child and while they were not trans while 
they were a student in FCPS, they did have peers who were, and the 
emotional issues that their peers faced were significant. I can't 
imagine how much worse things might have been if a policy such as the 
proposed one were in place then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I was a child, they called me "tomboy". I didn't know better and I was ashamed.</p>
<p>When I was a young adult, I cut my hair to feel more myself. They 
asked me if I was a boy or a girl. I didn't know how to answer and I was
 ashamed.</p>
<p>When I got older, I learned to hide. I wore my hair long and got 
married and kept my birth name and tried to pretend I was happy. I 
didn't know there was a healthier option and I was ashamed.</p>
<p>I know better now. I know I should have been a boy, a young man, a man.</p>
<p>Transition wasn't an option for me. It is an option for young people today. According to medical experts, it's a healthy option.</p>
<p>Youngkin should be ashamed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Good morning,</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I am writing about the 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, 
Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public 
Schools. As a school counselor and resident of Virginia I do not agree 
with the policy that is currently being proposed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The ASCA National Model that we follow also raises several 
points of concern between the policy and the guidelines that school 
counselors set out to follow. I have provided some key components from 
the model below:</p>
<p dir="ltr">A. RESPONSIBILITY TO STUDENTS&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A.1. Supporting Student Development&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">School counselors:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Have a primary obligation to the students, who are to be treated with dignity and respect as unique individuals.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Foster and affirm all students and their identity and psychosocial development.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">h. Respect students’ and families’ values, beliefs and 
cultural background, as well as students’ sexual orientation, gender 
identity and gender expression, and exercise great care to avoid 
imposing personal biases, beliefs or values rooted in one’s religion, 
culture or ethnicity.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">J.&nbsp; Advocate for equitable, anti-oppressive and 
anti-bias policies and procedures, systems and practices, and provide 
effective, evidence-based and culturally sustaining interventions to 
address student needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A. 10. Marginalized Populations&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">School counselors:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Advocate with and on behalf of students
 to ensure they remain safe at home, in their communities and at school.
 A high standard of care includes determining what information is shared
 with parents/guardians and when information creates an unsafe 
environment for students.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Actively work to establish a safe, 
equitable, affirming school environment in which all members of the 
school community demonstrate respect, inclusion and acceptance.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">E. Understand and advocate for all students’ right to be 
treated in a manner that honors and respects their identity and &nbsp; 
expression, including but not limited to race, gender identity, gender 
expression, sexual orientation, language and ability status, and to be 
free from any form of discipline, harassment or discrimination based on 
their identity or expression.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">F. Advocate for the equitable right and access to free, 
appropriate public education for all youth in which students are not 
stigmatized or isolated based on race, gender identity, gender 
expression, sexual orientation, language, immigration status, juvenile 
justice/court involvement, housing, socioeconomic status, ability, 
foster care, transportation, special education, mental health and/or any
 other exceptionality or special need.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia School Counselors Association also raises valid points. Below those are listed:</p>
<p dir="ltr">“VSCA recognizes that:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">56% of transgender youth reported a 
previous suicide attempt and 86% reported suicidality. School 
belongingness mitigates these risks and is a significant predictor 
variable for reducing suicidal ideation and attempts among transgender 
youth (Austin et al., 2020).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Transgender and nonbinary youth whose 
schools prevent them from using the restrooms/locker rooms that best 
matched their gender identities were significantly more likely to be 
sexually assaulted, 26% for transgender males and 149% for transgender 
females (Murchison et al., 2019).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">28% of transgender youth whose pronouns
 are not affirmed attempted suicide in the past year. In fact, when 
pronouns are respected, transgender youth attempted suicide at half the 
rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project,
 2020).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Transgender adolescents experience 
significantly disproportionate levels of childhood abuse compared to 
cisgender adolescents and experience greater levels of homelessness as a
 result of being kicked out or abused (Thoma, 2021).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr" style="list-style-type: disc;" aria-level="1">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Fewer than 2.5% of transgender youth re-transition to cisgender (Olson et al, 2022).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia school counselors work to remove barriers and 
support the social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students. 
VSCA Ends Policies state that “Virginia School Counselors are committed 
to working with and advocating for marginalized groups, promote the 
mental health and wellness of all students, adhere to the ASCA Ethical 
Standards for School Counselors, and actively work to dismantle 
destructive systemic inequities.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, Virginia school counselors follow the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) Position Statement on <a rel="nofollow" x="https://vsca.org/EmailTracker/LinkTracker.ashx?linkAndRecipientCode=L6RTA1gphhP9lBTZtbUiGvxeQOLbjXsPKpJN13NN0ZqUFCudUeX4bFRnE8ybi6OzKlzkTJzH47j3Fti0UsQcrnY5jLIPCbxo8bb52r0S2Pg%3d">The School Counselor and Transgender and Nonbinary Youth</a> (Adopted 2016, revised 2022) that states:&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">School counselors work to safeguard the well-being of 
transgender and nonbinary youth. School counselors recognize all 
students have the right to be treated equally and fairly, with dignity 
and respect as unique individuals, free from discrimination, harassment 
and bullying based on their gender identity and gender expression.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, Virginia school counselors seek to create 
environments that are not only inclusive and equitable for all students,
 including our transgender, nonbinary, gender non-conforming and 
gender-fluid students, but that celebrate the full scope of their 
identities, allowing them to thrive and reach their fullest potential. 
Furthermore, Virginia school counselors commit to dismantling any and 
all forms of inequity in Virginia’s public education system and fully 
support LGBTQ+ students. Every Virginia student, regardless of their 
gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation, has a right 
to learn free from discrimination and harassment.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">To conclude I do not believe that this policy is promoting 
equality amongst our students. I believe that this is giving more power 
to the parents and oftentimes the only place the students feel safe is 
at school and this is taking that away from them. If we have to contact a
 parent for permission and then not meet the request of the student due 
to the parents answer we are not doing any service to our students. We 
are supposed to be here for each student and this policy is not helping 
to show that we support all of our students no matter what. I hope that 
this is taken into consideration and that changes are made so that we 
are able to serve all students without the boundaries that are set in 
this new policy. Really the policy is for the parents and not reflective
 of student needs at all and this should not be the case nor will it be 
useful in progression in the school setting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Create gender neutral, one stalled restrooms. Every one can use 
regardless. This allows the separation if parents desire and a safe 
place for a trans student, student who has anxiety using the restroom in
 front of others, or a young lady embarrassed by monthly visitor, 
etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This new policy is needed, among others like it, to bring proper 
parental knowledge and control back into public education and the 
relationship schools should have with parents. Parents have primary 
responsibility for their children and should not cede those rights to a 
teacher, school or school system. No teacher, school or school system 
should attempt to take over those parental responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a Virginia voter, I am registering my opposition to the new 
guidance. Several of my friends are parents of trans or non-binary 
children, and they have told me how much happier and calmer their 
children became when their identity was affirmed by others.</p>

<p>The idea of counseling students in a school setting and keeping 
information from parents is wrong.&nbsp; Parents are responsible for 
their minor children and must deal with the consequences of anything 
that happens with the child.&nbsp; Parents cannot be undermined by the 
school system who does not have to deal with these consequences.&nbsp; 
Gender dysphoria is a family issue.&nbsp; The school should not be 
involved, and certainly should not keep information from parents or 
engage in counseling communications with the student without the 
parents.</p>

<p>I oppose the guidance and want the VDOE to reject this draft policy 
set out by Governor Youngkin. This policy harms transgender students who
 desire to learn in a focused environment. This will negatively affect 
transgender students who have poor rapport with one or both of their 
guardians.</p>

<p>As both a Christian and a mother of a trans child, I oppose this change in policy. <br><br>What
 would you like to be called at work, Governor Youngkin?&nbsp; What if I
 said it was my first amendment right to call you Mrs. Oldkin? Because 
my religion doesn't believe in men or in the word 'young'?&nbsp; We only
 believe in old women.&nbsp; We worship Carol Burnett, Julie Andrews, 
and Judi Dench.&nbsp; So, now you're Mrs. Oldkin. And I'm only going to 
address you by she/her pronouns (because I don't believe in men).</p>
<p>But, wait, that's not who you are, is it? And it doesn't really 
matter if my religion does or does not believe in men, men exist.&nbsp; 
And it doesn't really matter if my religion does or does not believe in 
the word 'young', because that word is accepted by most people as a 
legitimate and inoffensive word that describes people under a certain 
age.</p>
<p>Transgender people exist. Transgender is not a sin or a vice. 
Transgender (particularly early transitions, like my child) is generally
 accepted by the medical and psychological community as a legitimate 
difference in brain structure that matches the gender they are claiming.</p>
<p>Everyone has the right to determine how they are addressed by others.
 You won the election, so you get to be Governor.&nbsp; You inherited 
your last name, and you want to claim it. Thus, you're Governor 
Youngkin.&nbsp; If I walked into the Governor's mansion and started 
addressing you as Mrs. Oldkin, it would be offensive, even if I was 
doing it "with a good heart." It's not how you've asked to be 
addressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This new "model policy" effectively does that for every transgender 
child who has done the difficult and brave work of discovering who they 
truly are and ask to be addressed by their affirmed gender, name and 
pronouns. This policy is offensive, prioritizing the comfort and 
feelings of people who have done absolutely no research to understand 
the issue at hand.</p>

<p>Not only will this put transgender students under undue stress, it 
will also put them in unnecessary danger. This is a terrible idea.

<p>Outing an LGBT person is always wrong. At best, it will cause undue 
stress and anxiety. At worst it will cause violence against them. If the
 kid doesn’t feel safe coming out to their parents, that should be 
respected. It is objectively factual information that just using a trans
 kids chosen name reduces suicide by huge numbers. The fact this is even
 being considered is absurd.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Watching the government attack a tiny minority by attempting to 
legislate them out of existence is unbelievably disheartening. This is 
not in line with the will of all Virginia parents. Please stop acting as
 if this is on our behalf. It’s not. Your religious crusade against 
LGBTQ students and teachers is noted and opposed.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Protect Trans Youth</strong>
        </div>
        <div style="clear: right">&nbsp;</div>

        
        <div class="divComment">
          




<p>The 2021 policy enacted by the Department of Education created 
guidance to school boards and schools that protected trans and 
non-binary youth and provided an inclusionary learning environment for 
all students – exactly the role of public schools in our nation. This 
new proposed policy takes away protections that kids had to be free from
 harm in their learning environment, imposing standards that put them in
 danger in school and for some, at home. I urge the Board to reject this
 new policy and maintain the 2021 inclusive policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schools are to act in the best interest of the child and protect 
children while in their care. We train educators to identify bullying 
behavior and signs of abuse in the home and the steps they can take to 
intervene. By forcing an educator to use "birth assigned sex" when 
determining names and pronouns of children and teens instead of 
respecting the student, this policy will out trans students who are 
socially transitioned but, for whatever reason, have not gone through 
the process to make legal changes, increasing their risk of assault and 
bullying. For some trans and non-binary students, school is the only 
safe space in their life and the educators they interact with who are 
respectful of them are the key protective factor that leads to survival.
 This policy will take that away from at-risk youth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this policy is enacted, suicides in LGBTQ+ youth, especially trans
 youth will increase. Bullying of these same youth will increase. 
Targeted attacks of these same youth will increase. These are hyperbolic
 statements, but facts based on data from organizations like the CDC, 
who recommend that schools provide safe spaces for all youth, especially
 LGBTQ+ youth to reduce teen suicides. A 2019 NIH study documented that 
real and perceived safety at school is a protective factor for trans 
students in reducing suicidal tendencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a parent of a trans student, I implore you to prioritize the life 
of my child over the feelings of a few people with limited understanding
 of trans people. Prioritize saving children and keeping schools safe 
for every child, regardless of anyone's personal belief system. Reject 
this cruel policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Respectfully,&nbsp;<br>Amanda L. Pohl, LMSW, MDiv, MS</p>

<p>The trans ideology is destroying families.&nbsp; &nbsp;These kids are
 being groomed to reject their families.&nbsp; &nbsp;These kids need 
mental health support.&nbsp; &nbsp;Changing their identities isn't going
 to help their future.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is research out there that once
 they start this transformation that is when the risk of suicide 
increases.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you Youngkin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This document is ageist, transphobic, and homophobic. The idea that 
students can't decide how they want to be addressed in class without 
parental permission is absolutely insane and outrageous. This targets 
trans youth blatantly and is clearly a strategy to prevent kids from 
coming out and force them to conform to ancient and outdated cis and 
heteronormative standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are not "helping"&nbsp;<em>anybody</em> by forcing this 
conformity. Not allowing trans or nonbinary kids (nonbinary people are 
completely erased from this document) to use the pronouns they want or 
the names they want is absurd. Nobody would prevent "Annabelle" from 
going by "Anna" or a boy with long hair correcting his teacher for the 
pronouns he uses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, asking students to be "persistent and sincere" in their
 requests for use of different names/pronouns ignores how fluid gender 
identity is. Where is there room for a person coming of age to be 
questioning and experimental? We let people who fit inside of the gender
 binary experiment with goth phases and religious involvement, why don't
 we extend the same courtesy to trans/nonbinary people with their gender
 identity and expression.</p>
<p>We're not asking parents or teachers to get medically involved, this 
is basic human respect and dignity that we are stripping away from one 
of the least understood and valued groups in our society: our children.</p>
<p>Additionally, the use of "sex" to refer to "biological gender" is 
extremely outdated. The proposal itself has to toggle back and forth 
between what words it uses because "sex" can refer to gender assigned at
 birth, the act of having sex, and sexual orientation. It would be 
easier for everyone if we stopped using this archaic language and 
started using "gender assigned at birth". Gender is a social construct.</p>

<p>Growing up in the 1980's I wondered what kind of person I would have 
been during the Civil Rights movement of the 1950's and 60's. I was sure
 that I would fight for Civil Rights. I imagined how embarrassed Senator
 Byrd and Governor J. Lindsay Almond must be now. I wondered how they 
could live with themselves. How could they have so much hate?</p>
<p>But I now look at you Governor Youngkin and see the banality of hate.
 The ignorance that you and your supporters show is astounding. Has 
there ever been a situation where the people who were working against 
the civil rights of a group of children were considered to be in the 
right? You have aligned yourself with those who are the most destructive
 to continued human rights.</p>
<p>US law protects parents' rights to raise their child, but not hurt 
their child. Parents have the right to control what information is 
shared within their home, but not what information is shared in the 
public school. School can teach what science has learned about evolution
 and what science has learned about sexuality and gender. Evolution is 
strongly supported by evidence. That gender is socially constructed and 
defined is strongly supported by evidence. The <span id="page982R_mcid10"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">2022</span> Model Policies sound as backwards/uneducated as a belief that illness is the result of unbalanced humors or witchcraft.</span></p>

<p>I am in support of the guidance document being proposed in Virginia 
for our schools.&nbsp; Our girls are being assaulted and devalued by the
 policy of allowing males into female locker rooms, bathrooms, and 
sports teams. Parents have a right to know what is going on with their 
children, from birth into teenage years, without government 
interference.&nbsp; Teachers should not be forced to walk the line on 
topics outside of EDUCATION.&nbsp; My DIL quit teaching in PWC as she 
was not on board with the direction of education. Sex and gender 
identification does NOT belong in schools. Leave our kids alone.&nbsp; 
They are being indoctrinated into not being comfortable in their own 
skin.&nbsp; Transgender equality is already in place in our country 
without forcing everyone to take part. Stop the insanity in our schools!</p>

<p>I support the effort to put rights back where they belong when it 
comes to parents and families.&nbsp; Schools need to focus on reading, 
writing and history, the good and the bad, not gender studies.</p>

<p>There are many comments on here about how this is bad for "trans 
children." You people are delusional. Children, by definition, are not 
competent to make such decisions. Most of them don't know what to wear, 
or what they should have for breakfast. And YOU who oppose this support 
letting them make life-altering decisions at an early age, when there is
 PLENTY of evidence of how much damage it can do to them later, when 
they have reached the age of competence and realize they have ruined 
their lives. People who believe there is such a thing as "trans 
children" are supporting child abuse. Of course, these same people also 
support killing babies, which are scientifically, biologically, viable 
humans from the time the egg is fertilized. Apparently, the facts are 
lost on such people, who only want to parrot abusive lies from their far
 left masters. Just like it was in the Soviet Union when I was growing 
up.</p>
<p>Thank you, Gov Youngkin, for having the courage to stand up against 
the continuing lies and propaganda supported by those who would turn 
America into a socialist/communist backwater. Next, I suggest you invite
 the people who oppose this policy to move to one of the existing 
socialist/communist backwaters, where human rights are trampled and 
children are abused, and where parents have no say in how their children
 are raised - there are plenty of them available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transgender students are not villains or monsters, so stop treating 
them as such. They are people, trying to live their lives and be happy 
just like anyone else. Let them use the bathroom they choose. Respect 
their pronouns. Stop making their lives even more difficult.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is important for the health of individuals to allow everyone to use the bathroom associated with their declared gender.</p>
<p>It is in the best interest of every child that they are addressed by the name they associate with their being.</p>
<p>Virginia should not be known for bigotry, prejudice and HATE.</p>

<p>Can you let the kids be? Politics has no room when it comes to

their identity in a free and fair school environment. It will also serve

that differ from their name at birth.</p>

<p>Schools are expected to teach reading, writing, math, and thinking 
skills.&nbsp; They are not to be "change agents" to destroy the 
civilization that developed them.&nbsp; In a land of guaranteed freedom 
of speech and the press, those who wish to exercise these freedoms are 
being bullied into following the false "political correctness" of 
radicals.&nbsp; A boy may want to be called a girl, but the speaker 
should be free to use his own words and call the boy a boy under freedom
 of speech.&nbsp; Teachers should not be fired, or students censured for
 using their words as they see fit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bathrooms and locker 
rooms should reflect the actual nature of the persons involved, not 
their personally preferred pretend gender.&nbsp; A physical boy in a 
girls bathroom or locker room is a real danger, as has already been 
demonstrated in some schools.&nbsp; We must return to several thousand 
years of tradition and sanity.&nbsp; Hurray for and thanks to Governor 
Youngkin!</p>

<p>There is something particularly insidious about continually stripping
 children of basic human rights under the guise of keeping parents 
involved. Their kids should decide whether or not they feel comfortable 
sharing personal information with their parents, not teachers. A child's
 gender is, in no way, intertwined with children's educational career. 
The goal of this policy is obvious and painfully disheartening to see 
that adults are so willing to open children to potential harm for 
ideological gain.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose Governor Youngkin’s guidelines for schools 
regarding trans and non-binary students. I urge the board to listen to 
experts on this matter: the LGBTQ community and their advocacy 
groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a parent of a young child who is growing up being taught to 
respect others and appreciate difference and speak up for themselves, I 
want to keep my child and others as safe as possible, including giving 
them autonomy to choose what feels right in their life, not being told 
who they can be. There are so many issues that should be taking 
precedence of our state government beyond keeping a kid from using the 
name and pronouns they want to and being true to themselves. Politicians
 need to focus on giving more funding to schools, more support for 
teachers and staff, more resources for learning, more safety from guns 
and bullying and abuse and &nbsp;all the ways adults make things harder 
on children as it is. Make &nbsp;lives better and freer, not worse. I 
oppose this guidance and hope the VA DOE will get with the times and 
keep moving forward and not backwards. Equality and equity and safety 
and love for all children, no exceptions or conditions! Let them learn 
and live!</p>

<p>Trans and queer kids are just that— kids. By introducing 
discriminatory and hateful legislation against them, you are inviting 
violence and sending a clear message that they are seen as somehow less 
than a whole person and do not deserve basic protections. I strongly 
oppose legislation that prohibits trans kids from using their chosen 
name at school and using the bathroom that matches their gender 
identity. Teachers must be supported and encouraged to treat their 
students with respect, including using appropriate names and pronouns, 
or else we are teaching children that disrespecting human life is 
acceptable and that personal experience is not to be trusted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This proposal would significantly harm trans and non-binary youth. If
 it goes into effect, you could be subjecting many students to potential
 abuse and humiliation.</p>

<p>This political witch-hunt of the trans community is not without 
precedent. On 6 May 1933 Adolf Hitler sent his thugs to loot and burn 
the Institute of Sexology. The medical research was destroyed and the 
patients were murdered in the holocaust.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>this is what politicians do when they have run out of policies to 
help their nation or theor people. They vilify and kill the marginalized
 members of y community. Children be damned.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>The policies being discussed here are no less extreme. The current 
nonsense of hospitals forcing children into sexual reassignment surgery 
is absolutely ridiculous. First of all it already isn’t allowed under 
WPATH guidelines. But practically speaking even if it was it still does 
not happen. It is a rare and EXPENSIVE procedure for even adults. With a
 massive amount of medical gatekeeping besides. &nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>however restricting any and all health care for the trans community 
is incredibly dangerous. The data on the suicide rates alone should 
adequately show this. When you compare those numbers to the numbers 
collected after even socially transitioning (that is to say change of 
clothes, name, and pronouns) is DRAMATICALLY improved. Like few things 
in medicine have these success rates.&nbsp;<br><br>History is clear. 
Medicine is clear. An attack on the trans community is an evil attempt 
to deflect from the failures of politicians and it is one of the few 
true evils in this world. Do not follow in the footsteps of Adolf 
Hitler. Leave these children alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I support the Governor’s proposed&nbsp;</p>
<p>Policy. Parents have a right to be&nbsp;</p>
<p>involved in life altering decisions&nbsp;</p>
<p>and children lack the wisdom, maturity&nbsp;</p>
<p>man’s experience to make permanent life altering&nbsp;</p>
<p>decisions. And boys don’t belong in girls&nbsp;</p>
<p>restrooms or locker rooms. I don’t care who</p>
<p>they think they are.</p>

<p>As a Virginia citizen, voter, parent and educator, I strongly oppose 
this proposed policy. Our transgender and gender non-conforming students
 are extremely vulnerable and need school to be a welcoming and 
affirming place. Removing recent safeguards like access to gender 
neutral restrooms will do more harm than good. I urge you to reconsider 
these hateful policies that will put Virginia's children at further 
risk.</p>

<p>Dear Governor Youngkin,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;As an educator working in your state for 22 years, I’ve 
worked with thousands of students across elementary and middle school 
classrooms. &nbsp;I have seen firsthand what bullying looks like and the
 harm it can do to children. Sometimes it comes from supposed friends 
and peers. &nbsp;Other times it comes from outside of the school 
building and in the community. Schools should be a safe haven for ALL 
students. It is not a place to play politics. Our children are growing 
up in a society that is thriving on self-centered attitudes instead of 
empathy. This policy will only harm, not help. This will target children
 instead of protecting them. Play politics out on the campaign trail and
 leave Virginia’s children alone!</p>

<p>This is an absolute hate crime, and should very much not be passed. 
This endangers trans kids, and will put them through unbearable 
emotional pain. It is time to stand up, and protect our community. This 
bill will very much hurt every single Virginia kid, and if anyone takes 
inspiration from this bill, more kids will be endangered.&nbsp;<br>This isn't funny, and I look forward to seeing this have it's demise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a disgusting idea that will not help anyone-- it will only 
make queer children and transgender children scapegoats, while the kids 
who are actually harmed (usually by adults from their churches and 
schools) will see no justice. You should be ashamed of yourselves.</p>

<p>Trans kids are children dealing with the most some of the most 
difficult challenges of becoming an adult. They deserve our 
unconditional love and support and protection against dehumanizing 
policies that other them and bully them. Trans individuals have some of 
the highest rates of suicide in the US and policies like this are part 
of the reason why. Let's show trans kids how much we LOVE them so they 
can in turn know it's ok to love themselves too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>this policy is very harmful to trans youth and i do not support it.

<p>This new policy is hateful and harmful. Our LGBTQ youth shouldn't be 
made targets, shouldn't be outted to parents who may harm them, and they
 shouldn't be made to live in fear, which will happen if Gov Youngkin 
continues down this dangerous path.&nbsp;<br><br>LGBTQ students want 
equal access to education, and they can't have that when they are 
demonized, called names, and with policies that make it clear they are 
OTHER THAN!&nbsp; Asserting parents' rights is asserting parents' right 
to complete dominion and ability to groom their children in any way they
 see fit, regardless of how the child feels. If a child of 15 decides 
they don't want to be Christian and join a religious club of another 
faith at school, will the school be obliged to "out" them to their 
parents? These proposed policies strip every kid of any autonomy. It 
strips them of their individualism. It tells every kid that they don't 
know themselves and certainly can't make decisions for themselves.&nbsp;
 <br><br>My teen has picked which classes they have wanted to take since
 9th grade. My teen has chosen what sport to play. My teen will choose 
what college to attend. By Gov. Youngkin's logic, my teen should have no
 ability to have that decision-making. It is abhorrent, reckless, and 
without any science to back it up other than a bunch of zealots who can 
scream hate under the guise of parental choice. You are not hiding your 
homophobic, transphobic, and every phobia you have toward anyone that 
isn't following your same path. I hope every parent screaming about 
groomers, pedophiles, etc about our schools is blessed to have an LGBTQ 
child, but sadly that may mean a child out there will be faced with the 
ultimate betrayal by a parent: to hate their child under the guise of 
religion.&nbsp;<br><br>This hate is being driven by nothing but 
religion. My child's first amendment right means they have an individual
 right to live their life free from the harm of others. Gov. Youngkin is
 violating every LGBTQ child under the guise of forcing others to live 
by his religious convictions. Gov. Youngkin's legacy will be that of a 
one-term Governor who thought he could force his hate on others. The 
majority of Americans do not agree with your anti-LGBTQ policies. You 
are a minority, and if you want schools to teach hate, then do so but 
don't try and destroy our public schools and defund them under the guise
 of this unconscionable hate.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Another Step Toward Genocide</strong>
        </div>
        <div style="clear: right">&nbsp;</div>

        
        <div class="divComment">
          




<p>I am a 29 year old trans woman living in Richmond, VA. I started my 
transition at the age of 22 but had known about my identity as early as 
five years old. I grew up in a rural county where I had no idea what 
being trans meant. Had I understood the concept earlier in my life, I 
would be facing what this future generation is going to be facing, which
 is discrimination and ostracization. This is what Youngkin's policy is 
going to be bringing to children who are simply trying to live their 
lives without harming anyone in the process. This policy is meant to be a
 parentals rights policy, but why then if parent's rights are so 
important that they are not believed when they tell people that their 
child identifies as trans. Why is it then that a parent's word is also 
being scrutinized especially in states that are currently banning gender
 affirming care even with parental consent. It's simple, it is because 
this isn't about protecting parental rights nor is it about protecting 
children. If it was about protecting children then these lawmakers would
 go by the statistics we have regarding decrease in suicidality among 
trans people when their gender is affirmed and parents, classmates, 
friends, etc. are supportive. This is and always will be about 
controlling people. I say this is another step toward genocide because 
it is another state that is working toward making sure trans people are 
not shown the same human decency and respect that their peers will 
receive. It is about making sure these children are seen as different. 
Youngkin's policy much like other Republican governors, i.e. De Santis, 
seeks to make sure trans people and their freedoms are slowly taken away
 to the point that they believe that they can stop people from being 
trans. They're already in the process of taking away trans people's 
healthcare, and in Alabama it is a felony for doctor's to prescribe 
gender affirming care for those under 19 years old. I will say that 
again, 19 years old. Further explaining that this isn't just about 
children but an effort to make it so that people are not able to 
transition at all. These are stepping stones. It is an absolute disgrace
 knowing that these policies and laws are being made and that they are 
simply allowed to continue their efforts to take away another human 
being's right. This policy needs to be stopped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My little sister is in your school system. She has trans friends. 
When I told her about this guidance document change and what it would 
mean, she didn’t want to believe it. She denied it. She yelled at me. 
She made me pull up the document and show her, and then she left the 
room and sobbed for a good solid hour.&nbsp;<br>For so, so many trans 
kids, this is going to be horrible. As if discrimination against them 
wasn’t bad enough already. Do you know how stressful the public school 
system is? How utterly hostile and inhospitable? Do you know how many 
times I contemplated suicide, how many times my sister contemplated 
suicide? Well we’re still here. <em>Despite&nbsp;</em>the public school 
system. So you’re going to make an already inhospitable environment 
worse. Bear in mind that my sister and I are not trans. If it was that 
bad for us, how bad will it be for trans kids whose suicide rates are so
 much higher? This can, and mark my words <em>will</em> kill trans kids.
 I know you think you’re helping parents by doing this. I don’t care if 
you believe being trans is real or not, I don’t care if you think those 
kids are just confused. But you must consider what the consequences of 
your actions will be towards those children! Confused or not, school is 
often the only place they have away from parents who don’t believe or 
support them. Can you really bring yourself to take that away from them?
 Parental rights do <em>not</em> trump children’s lives. That’s why CPS 
exists. Are you ready to accept the moral responsibility of these 
guideline changes? Are you ready to have these children’s lives on your 
conscience?&nbsp;</p>

<p>All public school students across Virginia have the right to be let 
alone and not used as collateral in a political debate that started with
 a teacher tip-line and that has progressed to calling public school 
teachers "groomers".&nbsp; The number of college students pursuing 
education credentials has decreased over the past 10 years and our 
governor's political agenda is driving the best teacher and potential 
teachers out of the profession.&nbsp; Glen Youngkin's actions are an 
impediment to the success of our Commonwealth.&nbsp; If specific public 
school districts want to debate the 2021 guidelines, let them do so in a
 fair and open manner that is held to local accountability.&nbsp; Stop 
using the power of the state to control local school boards and divide 
parents along a non-issue.</p>

<p>I oppose these policies. These proposed model policies are contrary

<p>School should be a safe place for kids. Kids are going through 
changes and trying to figure out who they are. Parents are not always 
safe. Look at the rampant abuse of kids and teens in your state. Look at
 the statistics of kids kicked out of homes, removed my cps, ext. outing
 a child to their parents could be a death sentence.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><span style="color: black;">Parents should be the ones to set the overall K-12 C</span>urriculum.</strong>
 Teachers should be stopped from teaching or talking about sex and 
gender. God created a man and a woman and that's all there is. Also, 
they should not be teaching or talking about pronouns or other such 
nonsense. Our children should be protected from these types of extreme 
indoctrinations. </span></p>

<p>We are not talking about kindergarteners getting picked up by 
transgender witches who transfigure their genitalia, and therefore 
deserve to be burned. We are talking about teenagers attempting to find 
solace in their identities, we are talking about your son being bullied 
en masse by cruel classmates with this being supported by the 
government, we are talking about your daughter locked in the men’s 
restroom surrounded by people who may physically and emotionally scar 
her permanently. “Protecting our children” please. That’s what’s this 
bill is going to destroy. This bill is putting your children in the 
lions den, move them to the safety to express themselves, to the safety 
of their identity, away from the danger of bigotry. I beg to whatever 
ounce of kindness in your heart to take this bill away and burn it. When
 I was a kid I remember having a friend named Jaxon who was covered in 
bruises and scars because of policies like this. Put the blood libel 
down and listen to the children themselves before you lose the ones you 
love.</p>

<p>We need to honor and love our trans children, not shame them and 
castigate them. They should be called by their preferred names and 
pronouns. They should have adequate bathroom facilities that match their
 gender, not their biological sex. They should not fear being outed to 
abusive or unsupportive parents (I realize most parents are not abusive 
or unsupportive, but such parents do exist and schools should protect 
them from such parents). They should be loved, respected, and cared for 
by their teachers and school officials.</p>

<p>I am strongly opposed and deeply troubled by the proposed changes. As
 a United Methodist pastor, I remember several confidential 
conversations with LGBTQ youth and young adults who were claiming their 
identity and were terrified of the reaction of their parents if they 
learned who these young people truly were. There home would not be a 
safe space for them; for the public school system to systematically and 
intentionally "out" a student is dangerous and poses significant risk to
 their well-being. Not every parent is the "Donna Reed" parent Gov. 
Youngkin assumes is the case for all our students. There are many 
reasons for LGBTQ students to be tempted to suicide; parental 
intimidation and rejection is one of them. It seems to me that the 
proposed guidelines cannot effectively meet the commitment to letting 
parents have final say over all things related to the children and the 
commitment to the well-being of all students. I confess I am not 
hopeful, given the Governor's&nbsp; seeming commitment to a political 
base more than to genuine needs and sound science, I sincerely hope and 
pray these proposed guidelines will not be confirmed.</p>

<p>Many adults struggle with mental health crises because of the 
inability to express their true identity in a safe and accepting space 
as children. There is so much research about how trying to suppress 
children's identity leads to depression, anxiety, and life being taken 
too soon. School is already a battlefield for many who do not fit 
cleanly into societal standards. LGBTQ+ children deserve the same safety
 and agency that all children deserve. I believe that Youngkin's 
policies are a step backwards and will lead to much unnecessary pain and
 suffering and I fully oppose them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a mother of five and grandmother of 26 I strongly support the 
rights of parents as the primary educators of their children and the 
rights of children to be safe. The recent attacks of girls by boys using
 girls bathrooms is totally unacceptable as is the abuse of parents by 
extremist school boards. This model guidance is desperately needed to 
protect the innocence and safety of children in our public schools 
including to protect them from imposition of gender ideology and 
discrimination against people of faith. The schools need to return to 
teaching the basics: reading, writing, and arithmetic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I support the rights of all people to enjoy the liberties available 
to everyone, only limited where and act limits the liberties of others. 
This document is against liberties. It assumes majority cultural norms 
must be followed by everyone which encroaches on the liberties of the 
minority. This document is regressive, sending the state back to the 
darkness of the Middle Ages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The Department is mindful of constitutional protections that 
prohibit governmental entities from requiring individuals to adhere to 
or adopt a particular ideological belief." If you're so mindful of 
constitutional protection,&nbsp;<em>why&nbsp;</em>are you adopting a 
policy that targets the privacy that all LGBT+ members of society are 
rightfully allowed, given that the dangers of revealing themselves (of 
which include hate crimes and murder)? <em>Why&nbsp;</em>is this policy even being considered in the first place?</p>
<p>Parents only have the right to know whether or not a child will 
attempt to harm themselves or others, OR if their family members or 
someone they know will attempt those things. This doesn't apply to 
transgender individuals whatsoever, because being transgender doesn't 
make one prone to self-harm. Self-harm is linked to <em>mental distress,&nbsp;</em>not the type of gender one is. This entire policy is likely built up on a, pardon my French, <img src="VirginiaRegulatoryTownHallViewComments1_files/blackbox.gif" alt="black box" style="border: 0px; vertical-align: middle"> rhetoric that transphobic people use to further their disgusting and incorrect ideology.</p>
<p>If you really wanted to help trans kids, you wouldn't force them to come out to their parents, <em>especially&nbsp;</em>when those parents can turn around and become abusive towards their kids for such things! Shame on you!</p>
<p>Take your violation of rights and get it out of this state and its schooling system.</p>

<p>Just because you do not understand the experience of transgender 
individuals does not give you the right to treat them as anything less 
than full humans with every right you have. Educate yourselves, and stop
 being bigots.</p>

<p>I appreciate you giving parents control but the public school system 
is broken. After seeing the fluff they are teaching I kept my child out 
of public school.</p>
<p>There's not enough teachers or teacher's aids. No subs for anything. 
They are forcing teachers out and replacing them with people they can 
control. History is a joke. We need to dismantle the DOE and start 
teaching real History and math and science. Not this nonsense they're 
trying to pass off as education</p>

<p>This bill gravely impacts the freedom of humans to express themselves
 and their gender safely. It is imperative to a free society that we 
support bodily autonomy for all. Anyone who wishes to pursue happiness 
should be free to do so, especially within the limits of their body and 
choices. It is the right of life that ensures the necessity of liberty, 
and nowhere is liberty more sacred than in the relationship of a person 
with their body and how they carry it in the world.</p>

          <strong>I reject Gov Youngkin's anti-trans policies</strong>

<p>I write to stand against Governor Youngkin's transphobic policies.</p>
<p>Governor Youngkin's policies are rooted in transphobia and only seek 
to further harm trans and non-binary kids. They create a hostile and 
potentially dangerous school environment for those same students as they
 require teachers and staff to forcibly out students to their parents 
against the student’s will.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Youngkin’s policies would prohibit educators from using students’ 
affirming names and pronouns to help support their students and their 
mental health. Putting trans students further into harm's way, they also
 force the students into a bathroom and sports policy that do not adhere
 to their true gender identity, making them potential targets for 
bullying, abuse, and violence.<br><br>Governor Youngkin’s policies also 
explicitly contradict state law and are illegal. In 2021, Governor Ralph
 Northam signed the Virginia Values Act into law after it was passed 
through the General Assembly. This law prohibits discrimination in 
public and private employment, credit, housing, and public 
accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, 
among other additional protected categories. The protections in this act
 have been extended to protect LGBTQ+ youth in Virginia public schools 
throughout the Commonwealth to prohibit discrimination, harassment, and 
violence in against these students.<br><br>I cannot stand for these 
policies to be illegally forced upon Virginia's students in the name of 
the Republican Party's so-called “parent’s rights” campaign against 
kids. We need to protect trans kids, and these policies only seek to 
harm and further marginalize LGBTQ+ people.<br><br>Thank you.</p>
<p>Respectfully,<br>Colleen Moore<br>Arlington, VA</p>

<p>This isn’t about parents it’s about a child as a person in their own 
right and an individual. &nbsp;They have rights too, including to their 
is. Thoughts and sense of self. &nbsp;We have no right to take that from
 them and focus on parents instead. If a child felt comfortable telling 
their parent, they would! &nbsp;And we can help them get to that point, 
but somethings that is not an option. Stop endangering our lgbtq youth!</p>

<p>I find it hard to enter into a policy discussion with an 
administration whose baseline policy outlook seems to include the view 
that trans people do not exist. Is the idea that trans people are some 
kind of mix-up that can be cured by religion, or stern parenting, or 
perhaps some other means?</p>
<p>Actually they are our brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers, 
children... you know, Governor, our loved ones? The people we are 
commanded by God to cherish and support and uplift?</p>
<p>I just don't see what you see here, man. Hope you change your mind.</p>

<p>Please don't repeal anything that protects trans kids. When trans 
kids are misgendered, deadnamed, or otherwise made to feel unsafe, they 
are more likely to harm or kill themselves. I am trans and am 
missgendered all the time. I am 44 years old and it hurts and is 
exhausting. For a child, it is so much worse. Protect all children and 
give them safety. Don't let bigotry and hate harm children.</p>

<p>Instead of vilifying and condemning trans people. Try kindness, 
acceptance and accommodation. Stop the hatred. People just wan't to live
 their lives free of bullying and persecution.&nbsp; Trans people are a 
threat to NO ONE. Stop demonizing marginalized people. Where is the 
empathy. People do not ask to be different. They just are. Come down of 
your high moral horse of bigotry and hypocrisy. People are people. Stop 
creating enemies out of innocent people.</p>

<p>Finally someone with common sense is protecting girls from having 
boys in their private spaces. The schools are out of control &amp; 
children are destroying their lives with this woke nonsense.</p>

<p>Faith doesnt need to be had to recognize the effects that gender 
dysphoria have on youth. Differring to parents on these things futher 
alienates children and creates the silenced situations in which things 
kike suicide thrive. If you cant reconcile that with a book thats a 
thousand years old, perhaps blame it on progress. Either way, faith isnt
 needed to see the effect on our kids when we try to tell them who they 
are, rather than listening to what they say.</p>

<p>School should be a safe place for kids. Kids are going through 
changes and trying to figure out who they are. Parents are not always 
safe. Look at the rampant abuse of kids and teens in the state. Look at 
the statistics of kids kicked out of homes, removed by CPS, ext. Outing a
 child to their parents could be a death sentence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The data is clear: you can't make trans kids not trans by denying 
them care and acknowledgment; all you can so is harm them.&nbsp; Trans 
children that are denied care, including acknowledgment, acceptance, 
privacy, and the ability to go through life as their gender, have 
substantially higher suicide rates.&nbsp; If you want dead kids, then go
 ahead with this bill.&nbsp; I, for one, oppose it and cannot understand
 anyone who supports policies that will literally kill our children.</p>

<p>That there are a disproportional number of anonymous and cowardly 
spam comments from people who have no interest in actual human society 
should speak volumes to the rest of us who are thinking caring adults 
who live in a modern world full of a rich and amazing diversity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our communities are made stronger by this. Our children are protected
 and encouraged to explore and be who they are as opposed to an 
alternative which condemns them and raises the rate of suicide in this 
country.&nbsp; As a fully faithful Christian my entire life I'm 
completely in favor of this.</p>

<p>Parents should have the final say in something so critical. The 
students are still children with still growing brains and very few life 
experiences to model them. They do not belong to the state and taking 
more and more decisions away from the parents who know them best, is a 
horrible idea.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I strongly support Governor Youngkin's 
Model Policy on the Privacy, Dignity and Respect for All Students and 
Parents. &nbsp;This policy would challenge the Marxian strategy which 
seeks to make our children wards of the state and drive a wedge between 
parents and children at every turn. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition, it protects the privacy and 
safety of our girls who do not want to share a locker room or hotel room
 with a biological male. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Don't listen to the fear-mongering. &nbsp;This is good, common sense policy that reasonable people support.</p>

<p>This policy will only result in harm to an already vulnerable 
population. This policy makes it impossible for school personnel to use 
discretion in working with trans and non-binary students in a manner 
that best serves the students and guarantees their safety.</p>

<p>This will only cause further harm to trans youth. By forcing teachers
 to deadname and misgender trans students, a precedent is being set that
 erases trans youth and by extension trans adults. If a cisgender 
student wanted a nickname or different name to be used, there wouldn’t 
be any issue. This motion deliberately isolates and infringes on the 
rights of students and will only add to the already striking suicide 
rates among lgbtq youth.</p>

<p>Thank you Governor Youngkin for protecting &nbsp;to parents rights 
for the care and safety of &nbsp;their children. Children belong to 
their families, not the state or the public school system.</p>

<p>I graduated from the College of William and Mary in 2019 and received
 a Master’s in Counseling form William &amp; Mary in 2021. I currently 
work as resident counselor at a private mental health counseling 
practice.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>Governor Youngkin’s policy on transgender students claims to be about
 protecting students, but there is no evidence that any student will be 
protected by these laws. The agreed upon treatment of a child 
experiencing gender dysphoria is allowing them to social transition via 
wearing gender affirming clothing and going by a name which makes them 
feel comfortable. Preventing this in a school setting where dramatically
 increases the risk of suicide among transgender students. Furthermore, 
allowing social transitioning poses no threat to the student 
transitioning or their classmates. Fear-mongering about male students 
pretending to be trans to sneak into girls bathrooms/locker rooms are 
entirely a media fabrication. In reality, trans students are 
overwhelmingly more likely to be the victims of violence than to be the 
perpetrators, and to pretend otherwise is to be willfully 
ignorant.&nbsp;<br><br>Furthermore there is strong evidence that these 
laws directly lead to bullying, violence, and discrimination against not
 only transgender students, but also any cisgender student who (by their
 own choice or not) do not strictly conform to gender stereotypes. For 
example, there are many cases of cisgender girls who have been barred 
from playing school sports because they naturally appear more masculine.
 Also, these policies would give teachers license to shame and harass 
any student who they believed was not behaving in a way that they felt 
aligns with the gender they were assigned at birth. If these policies go
 into affects, many Virginia students will face immense harm, and many 
trans students will be pushed to suicide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governor Youngkin is of course aware of all of these facts. He knows 
that by making these laws, he will be making Virginia schools 
demonstrably less safe for any student who does not fit in with their 
peers. He knows it will lead many transgender students to kill 
themselves or drop out, or simply suffer silently. That is the reason he
 is suggesting it. Governor Youngkin would rather see hundreds of 
children dead than accept that some children are different from others, 
and that those different children are worthy of life. He and his GOP 
allies wish nothing more than the eradication of transgender and gay 
people, and they do not care who gets caught in the crossfire.</p>

          <strong>Harming children under the guise of parental rights</strong>

<p>As an educator, a parent, an aunt and a HUMAN BEING, I strongly 
oppose this bill that puts children at direct risk for harassment, 
ridicule, and their own safety. Schools are supposed to be a safe haven 
for students that may not have support at home. Schools are places of 
learning- and if we can’t learn from one another, then what are we 
doing? Schools are places where we can either support ALL students, or 
we can make it a place where some students are reported- like the 
gestapo. This teacher refuses to report and will continue to honor a 
student’s chosen identity and teach others that the differences in each 
of us is what learning and understanding is all about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t be fooled- this isn’t about a parent’s rights. It’s about 
harming the children that are already at the highest risk for suicide. 
Parents have plenty of rights- remember you have the right to send your 
child to a school that will choose to discriminate. But public schools 
accept everyone and treat everyone with the same respect they deserve. 
At least they used to be. I have hope they will continue to be.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>I sympathize with transgender students and their parents.&nbsp; I 
can't possibly imagine the challenges they face.&nbsp; However, I 
strongly believe that parents need to be included in any key decisions 
that affect their children.&nbsp; This new policy document upholds 
parental rights: "<span id="page7R_mcid5"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Parents have the right to make decisions with respect to their children</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">: Policies shall</span>&nbsp;<span dir="ltr" role="presentation">be drafted to safeguard parents’ rights with respect to their child, and to facilitate the</span>&nbsp;<span dir="ltr" role="presentation">exercise of those rights....<span id="page7R_mcid29">Schools shall defer to parents to make the best decisions with respect to their children."</span></span></span></p>

<p>Life is hard enough for our youth, let alone for the gay and trans 
youth. Why are we turning back the pages in time to more hate and 
bigotry? Outing kids to their parents? Why? What purpose does that 
serve? Don’t you think if these children felt safe to come out they 
would have done so already to their parents? Great; now they may be 
homeless, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As if trans kids don't have enough problems, not only is it okay in 
Governor Youngkin's eyes to out them to potentially abusive families, he
 wants it mandated, and wants every facet of their academic life to 
emphasize that they're different from their cis peers. Has anyone 
stopped to think how alarming it is that we're apparently supposed to 
define children by their genitalia and not by the identities they forge 
for themselves? I'm starting as a substitute in a Virginia school 
district soon and if it comes down to it, I'm not complying with this. 
If it costs me my position, so be it. I will never punish a child for 
trying to figure out who they are.</p>

<p>Our government and our education system should be doing everything in
 their power to PROTECT trans kids, not causing them further harm and 
isolation. All children deserve the dignity of existing as they are, 
being called the name and pronoun they prefer and being allowed to use 
the restroom they are most comfortable using. We should not be policing 
their bodies, their gender expression or anything else about who they 
are. We should be working as a community and a commonwealth to provide a
 safe, comprehensive education for them in a healthy, accepting 
environment. Banning gender expression does not protect kids, it harms 
them. You can not stop kids from being trans, but if this passes, you 
will be putting their lives in real danger. Protect trans kids. Oppose 
this guidance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The proposal seeks to support the verbal, psychological and physical 
abuse of children by limiting transgender and gender diverse youth from 
protections clearly established for all. Attempting to segregate them as
 a second class citizen is a clear breach of both U.S and international 
law and human rights. As such all provisions such as: referring to 
pupils by their chosen name and pronouns,&nbsp; allowing students to use
 space reserved for a specific gender/sex as match their gender 
identity, protection from harassment or bullying by adults or children 
(especially hostile parents), etc must be upheld. The actions in this 
proposal will be lethal to&nbsp; transgender and gender diverse youth, 
from abusive parents and peers to pushing them towards suicide. No 
reasonable, rational human with any empathy or care for another could 
support this motion.</p>

<p>This policy is cowardly and incredibly regressive and needs to be rejected across&nbsp;</p>
<p>the board. It reminds me a lot of the unhinged ‘Satanic Panic’ hysteria of the 1980s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Youngkin’s administration is throwing out red meat to his Evangelical base. As always,&nbsp;</p>
<p>the cruelty is the point with such targeted policy and legislation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This would be yet another terrible policy decision by the Youngkin 
administration.&nbsp; "Parental rights" are the new boogeyman to fire up
 the Republican base.&nbsp; In this particular case, it will actually 
kill people.&nbsp; The adverse mental health implications are 
potentially too severe to force students to be addressed by improper 
pronouns.&nbsp; This is already a case of settled law in the 
Commonwealth, it does not need to be revised.&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Oppose--Negative Impact on Trans Students' Mental Health</strong>

<p>Hello,<br>My name is Emmy Johnson, and I'm a therapist, social 
working, and Clinical Care Coordinator for Gender Affirmative Care at 
Center for Discovery, an eating disorder treatment company that has 
several locations in Northern Virginia (McLean, Alexandria, Fairfax). I 
worked as a primary therapist at the McLean location for a year and a 
half, and in my current role, I support transgender and gender 
questioning adults and youth at all Virginia (and all nationwide) 
locations. </p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Affirmation and support of someone’s gender identity is associated 
with the best mental health outcomes and has been repeatedly linked to 
meaningful improvements in eating disorder symptoms, suicide ideation 
and self-harm (Catalpa &amp; McGuire, 2018; Klein &amp; Golub, 2016; 
McConnell et al. 2016; Russell &amp; Fish, 2016; Ryan et al., 2010; 
Travers et al., 2012 , Durwood, McLaughlin, and Olson, 2017; Katz-Wise 
et al., 2018; Kuvalanka et al., 2017; Olson et al., 2016; Simons et al.,
 2013; Veale et al., 2017, Sevelius et al., 2020, Jones et al, 2016; 
Nowaskie et al., 2021; Owen-Smith et al., 2018; Testa et al., 2017, de 
Vries et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2018). Among my clients, invalidation 
of their gender is regularly cited as a factor in the onset of their 
eating disorder, and the ability to be themself--to be seen and 
acknowledged as themself--is a key part of their recovery journey.</div>
<div><br>I strongly oppose the proposed Model Policy. This policy would 
require non-affirmation of students in their gender, require outing 
students who may come from homes where it is unsafe to come out, and 
prevent all students from learning about the normal spectrum of gender 
and sexuality. In my professional opinion, based on the best research 
available as well as my professional experience, this policy will 
increase rates of eating disorders, self-harm, and suicide.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would be happy to discuss the research and my professional experience further, should that be helpful.</div>

<p>This policy is nothing more than the result of a ginned up panic by 
conservative bigots targeting a marginalized, vulnerable minority 
population. Under this policy, some cisgender children wouldn't even be 
able to use their nicknames--this just demonstrates what a slapdash, 
firehose of a proposal this is, all in the name of targeting trans 
children's right to live as they choose, and also in the name of riling 
up the hateful mob that constitutes the governor's supporters.</p>

<p>Protect trans kids! People are all for "the rights of parents" until 
those parents support their children, in which case, they are known as 
child abusers. Because you can only do exactly what they want you to do.
 Be yourself! This is a bill actively against the happiness and 
wellbeing of children. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, are 
all being undermined, and as such, I oppose it wholeheartedly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the new 2022 guidance put forth to curtail human 
rights of transgender children. &nbsp;The guidance focuses a great deal 
on the fundamental rights of parents to direct their children's 
educations. While I agree that is a fundamental due process right under 
the 14th Amendment, such rights (or ANY rights) should never be at the 
expense of the fundamental rights of another. &nbsp;A parent's rights to
 censor what their child learns at school does not trump a child's right
 to a safe, inclusive, free public education. &nbsp;FULL STOP. Moreover,
 parents are given a say in public education by electing local 
officials, school boards, school committee members, etc. &nbsp;That is 
the end of a parent's right to direct what is taught in schools - as it 
should be. &nbsp;Public education is just that. &nbsp;If parents want 
more input on their child's education, perhaps they should consider home
 schooling or private schooling. &nbsp;All children in the Commonwealth 
of Virginia should be afforded a safe, welcoming learning environment - 
one inclusive of all children. &nbsp;Virginia is better than this. Do 
better for our children and vote NO.</p>

<p>We have watched Virginia schools coerce students into lgbtq community
 by inappropriately “identifying” them as they see fit for years! They 
are able to do this through questionnaires and surveys and secret lunch 
groups at school with teachers and advisors. . A student went home and 
told her mother she was pan sexual, the parent asked what that meant, 
the student replied “I don’t know” &nbsp;She was attending an lgbtq 
lunch group falsely &nbsp;labeled. &nbsp; The schools have no business 
“identifying” children and the secret surveys they are sending to the 
students need to STOP! &nbsp;</p>

<p>I can’t begin to imagine that THIS out of all things is what people 
are losing their heads over. Not the teacher shortage, not their 
children learning about math and science, but this. People who support 
this are monstrous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I took my granddaughter out of public school after I witnessed the 
fluff they are teaching.&nbsp; No real history, math or science. Most 
kids can't read or write. Superintendents running off good teachers and 
replacing them with young people they can control. I appreciate giving 
parents control but until the education system is brought up to 
par....I'll never send her back. No one wants to work in public school 
anymore. Can't find subs for anything. It's a total disaster. Dismantle 
the DOE and start over!</p>

<p>Guidance protocols like this encourage at-home abuse for at-risk 
children. The number one cause for suicides among trans youth are 
unsupportive environments. This policy is putting these poor kids on a 
sacrificial mount for the sake of a conservative culture war win. We 
should not be forcing kids to live as someone they are not for the sake 
of appeasing parents who don’t “agree with it”. We must support 
transgender youth and allow them to live and express themselves as they 
see fit. You are sentencing children to death.</p>

<p>I oppose this proposed policy in the strongest possible terms. This 
would strip trans and gender fluid students of the protections they 
currently have in our public schools. It is also an attack on Virginia's
 educators. For far too many trans and gender fluid students, school is a
 sanctuary, a place where they have more protections and who they are is
 affirmed to a greater degree than any place else, even at home. Parents
 who love and accept their children for who they are support the 
protections that are currently in place: protections that include 
allowing trans students to use the bathroom that aligns with their 
gender identity, rather than their biological sex. Protections also 
exist currently for trans gender pronouns and names. Teachers in 
Arlington Public Schools are directed to make sure they refer to a 
student by the name and pronoun they want to be called. No consultation 
or deferral to parents is required, or necessary. This is as it should 
be. These policies would take those protections away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Transgender children are not predators, but victims. It does not harm
 any child to go by a different name or pronouns at school, and it would
 be a massive breach of confidentiality and privacy to disclose this 
information to parents. Think, would you go up to a random cop and tell 
them you have a gun? It is harmless information, and needs to stay 
private so students do not go home to abuse.</p>

<p>I strongly oppose the model policies drafted by Governor Youngkin and
 his department of education. Written under the guise of "parental 
rights" and "privacy," these policies won't protect student privacy or 
parental rights but WILL cause harm to students who do not feel 
comfortable being out at home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for "religious freedom," parents are free to send their children 
to religious schools, which are aligned with their faith (and, in some 
instances, their bigotry) if they so desire. Public schools, however, 
are for ALL, and every single student MUST feel safe and affirmed while 
at school even gender diverse kids. Kids who don't feel safe are not 
ready to learn and, for a Governor so obsessed with our supposedly 
failing public schools, he sure is picking a strange and ineffective way
 to address "learning loss."&nbsp;</p>
<p>These model policies are a blatant violation of the <a rel="nofollow" x="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-human-rights-act/" target="_blank">Virginia Human Rights Act</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" x="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title22.1/chapter3/section22.1-23.3/" target="_blank">§ 22.1-23.3 of the Code of Virginia</a> AND disregard the ruling by the 4th Circuit Court in <a rel="nofollow" x="https://www.aclu.org/cases/grimm-v-gloucester-county-school-board" target="_blank">Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board</a>.
 They're vindictive and cruel, did not consider evidence-based best 
practice, and are nothing but a political power grab by a pandering 
presidential-hopeful.</p>

<p>We’ve made so much progress in gender equality in recent years and this decision is nothing short of horrifying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bullying in schools is very much still an issue and this will only serve to make things worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m embarrassed to live in Virginia. This is a huge step backwards.</p>

<p>”Empowering parents is not only a fundamental right, but it is 
essential to improving outcomes for all children in Virginia.“ This 
includes trans kids, and the best way you can empower trans children is 
to support them in their transition and ask what they need. Making a 
hostile education environment will do nothing but harm and cause long 
lasting damage to these children. Think about if this is for the selfish
 reasons of an adult that is in no way related to the child or if it’s 
actually for the “safety” of children because I can guarantee that it is
 not the latter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I absolutely and completely oppose this new model policy. It is 
nothing but hate wrapped up in religion and double standard. The policy 
purports to be a method by which to protect kids, but it clearly doesn’t
 mean ALL kids. It means I my kids who are cisgender and heterosexual. 
That MUST be the only kids it aims to protect, because the actual 
policies it contains would do real harm to trans and non-binary kids. 
Allowing kids to be dead-named every single day will cause immense 
psychological damage. There’s already an epidemic of mental health 
issues and suicide amongst trans and non-binary youth. This policy would
 exacerbate that. In addition, teaching kids that they can harm others 
in the name of religion is absolutely despicable - and I say that as a 
practicing Christian. This policy is disgusting and hateful.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Controversial social health issues course. &nbsp;</strong>Schools,
 colleges, churches, businesses, etc. provide a valuable service when 
they encourage people to educate themselves about people who are 
different. But you don’t improve intergroup relations by making certain 
groups wrong, as many are prone to do in this age of political 
correctness and divisiveness, CRT being today’s most evident example. 
Moreover, one-off anti-bias or sensitivity trainings like Starbucks 
offers has little lasting value as research has shown, even though these
 might help disingenuous white business owners feel better and perhaps 
enhance their bottom line.</p>
<p>Rather than offer anti-bias training apart from other controversial 
social health issues, help people discover and deal with the various 
biases that make us human through well-crafted, voluntary courses of 
study that address several of a community’s hot social health issues. We
 have no lack of these:</p>
<p>§ Bullying §&nbsp;Opioid/drug abuse&nbsp;§ School shootings and 
disciplinary incidents&nbsp;§ Mental health breakdowns&nbsp;§ Teen 
suicides&nbsp;§ Sexual misconduct&nbsp;§ Interracial strife § 
Homelessness&nbsp;§ Deteriorating police-youth relations&nbsp;§ 
Assimilating recent immigrants, § Urban riots destroying and looting 
property, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Keeping such issues in their disciplinary silos through separate 
programs to address every problem is neither engaging, effective nor 
affordable. Much as the work of organizations that address these issues 
is admirable, their highly targeted responses tend not to provide 
sufficient time and subject matter breadth for the in-depth training in 
emotional intelligence that today’s world requires. In a word, our 
communities must build better people to deal with this evermore complex 
world, and that requires opportunities over time to practice building 
healthy relationships in continually shifting situations.&nbsp;Such a 
course, probably team taught, would seem as important as any other.</p>
<p>Students, and for that matter most Americans, need courses, retreats 
and town meetings that would help them develop and defend points of view
 on controversial social health issues and listen carefully and 
respectfully to one another while they argue. I largely developed and 
taught such a course at Berkeley High School (CA) that remained in the 
curriculum for over 25 years (links below). Race relations was among the
 topics that a student class could choose to cover in the course’s 50 
hours; however, the issue of race often came up in discussing and 
debating other topics, such as drug abuse, police-youth relations and 
human sexuality. Backing into such discussions involving race was just 
as if not more effective than a unitary focus on it. One of my 
successors wrote a book about her experiences with this “social living” 
course.</p>
<p>The State of Virginia could fund the updating of this course with the
 help of prominent health and social service organizations and offer the
 associated teacher training package to schools, colleges and community 
organizations that would like to run with it. The state should also 
design and fund a long-term evaluation through the competitive bid 
process.</p>

<p>If this proposal ever comes to fruition, it will do so much more harm
 than good. It will alienate and put trans students directly into harms 
way from their peers. It would take so little to help these students 
(who are already going through the confusing and scary situation of 
growing up and becoming adults) feel comfortable, but banning them from 
being able to even exist as themselves in schools is completely 
monsterous.</p>

<p>All this is going to do is make their lives at school more 
emotionally taxing than they already are, as well as put some in 
potentially physical danger. Stop projecting your own discomfort about 
trans people existing onto kids who are just trying to live their best 
possible life and leave them alone. I can tell you from personal 
experience that being forced to live opposed to one's gender identity 
leads to a lifetime of traumas that are difficult to overcome.</p>

<p>This proposal made by Glen Youngkin is filled with all kind of weasel
 words and political jargon to hide it's true intention. Namely to strip
 transgender kids of their rights and to deprive of them of a safe 
environment where they can express themselves. By implementing this 
proposal it would turn schools from a safe haven into a prison like 
environment where one is punished for not conforming to the gender norm 
one was given by their parents. I respect that parent's have a right to 
educate their children in the way that they see fit, however this right 
should not hinder a child's development into the person they want to 
grow up to be. This proposal would give the Virginian government and 
Virginian schools the legal possibilities to publicly out transgender 
children and to ban them from using the school's utilities(bathrooms 
etc) in a way that conforms with their gender identity. If implemented 
it will lead to situations where transgender kids may find themselves 
threatened with their lives, either via their classmates or hostile 
school stuff or via their parents who object to their gender identity. 
It would lead to systematic discrimination of the state and private 
actors against transgender children and will costs the lives of many of 
them.&nbsp;<br><br>The proposal tries to justify itself by using phrases
 like "Freedom of the parents to educate their child" and "consultation 
with educational leaders". However if implemented this will reduce the 
freedom of a large group of people. If Glen Youngkin and the Republican 
party really cared about freedom as much as they claim they do then they
 would recognize this and not come with proposals like this. Reality 
however proves otherwise which shows to the world that they do not care 
about freedom but rather about control. Control of transgender children 
and of transgender people in general. Furthermore if implemented could 
this policy have repercussions far beyond the state of Virginia. It 
could lead to implementation of similar policies in other US states and 
beyond and it would affect far more people then imagined.&nbsp;<br><br>I
 urge everyone reading my comment to resist this proposal by blocking 
efforts to further legislation like this. This can be done via protests,
 strikes or by spreading the news and denouncing it far and wide. We 
cannot allow a small group of people like this to determine the faith of
 thousands if not millions of people. Resist the Fascist tyranny of the 
GOP now, Resist tomorrow and resist for always.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This proposal is hateful, ignorant, and divisively partisan. It is a 
political gambit from an undeclared presidential candidate designed to 
curry favor with MAGAts, no matter how many vulnerable kids it harms. 
Cruelty is a GOP feature, not a bug.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am a liberal person who believes that trans kids need to be 
supported and not bullied, I have been through these discussions and 
explorations with my own kids and feel intimately involved in what these
 feelings and impulses look like in pre-teens. &nbsp;I also believe 
fully that there are elements of social contagion that is driving the 
current tidal-wave of self-identified trans kids.</p>
<p>It is because I have thought so much about this that I believe that 
the original policy which not only allowed, but encouraged schools to 
keep parents out of these discussions and decisions around gender was 
deeply wrong and destructive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not support all of the elements of the Governor's new policy (I 
could not care less about bathrooms), and I did not vote for him. 
&nbsp;However, I was relieved that the new policy brought parents role 
back to the forefront, which is essential. &nbsp;I would suggest that 
maybe there be provision to provide a work-around for instances when the
 school believes that abuse or real harm may occur because of parental 
involvement. &nbsp;It could be a court or psychologist approved system 
that gives schools flexibility, but is more than just a pre-teen asking 
to hide something from their parents, which should never be the position
 of the government to encourage or facilitate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for this policy change. &nbsp;I am relieved and grateful.</p>

<p>This policy is disgusting and extraordinarily discriminatory against 
trans people especially trans kids who just need support but are getting
 support yanked from under them because if policies like these. This is 
going to lead to suicides, abuse and homicides and those deaths will be 
on your hands. This is an awful policy that I strongly oppose.</p>

<p>Nearly everything the right says about queer populations are lies 
based solely on scaremongering and their disgust with our lives. Leave 
queer people alone, they will live their lives and be valuable members 
of your population.</p>
<p>This includes trans kids, who are not now, nor have they ever been, a
 threat to anyone. Like every other panic, this is using the 
imaginations of conservatives to push a minority into a vulnerable 
position where they can be violently eliminated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you actually cared about these populations, you would support them
 and listen to them. Trans kids don't grow up to be Cis, and gender 
affirming care saves lives. Please stop trying to regulate the lives of a
 tiny vulnerable minority. All of the supposed concerns disintegrate 
under even moderate examination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a parent of a student in Virginia public schools and as a 
long-term substitute teacher in FCPS, I was appalled at how much leeway 
the school had in the previous model policies to hide information from 
parents. We live in a society where children require parental/guardian 
permission to go on a field trip, get a tattoo, get a piercing, or 
attend extracurricular activities, just to name a few, yet we would 
allow the school to begin transitioning our children's gender identities
 without parental knowledge? This is not only a blatant violation of 
parents' trust; it is a gross, abusive overreach of the state's power.<br>The
 new model policies put parents back into their rightful place as 
ultimately responsible for the upbringing of their children and it is 
the right thing to do.</p>

<p>I am appalled at this proposed new draft model policy. It runs 
directly against all the values that we should prioritize as Virginians.
 As a family member of a trans individual, I am deeply ashamed that our 
state would put such a policy on the books. If these policies were to 
pass, I could not allow my family member to come visit our great state 
out of concern for the transphobia these policies will surely amplify. 
The VDOE should reject these policies.</p>

<p>This policy is inhumane and immoral. What happened, Governor, to the 
Jeffersonian dictum that the least government is best? Stay out of our 
families’ most personal and sacred decisions!</p>

<p>Another citizen of the Commonwealth captured my thoughts exactly:</p>
<p>"The 2021 policy enacted by the Department of Education created 
guidance to school boards and schools that protected trans and 
non-binary youth and provided an inclusionary learning environment for 
all students – exactly the role of public schools in our nation. This 
new proposed policy takes away protections that kids had to be free from
 harm in their learning environment, imposing standards that put them in
 danger in school and for some, at home. I urge the Board to reject this
 new policy and maintain the 2021 inclusive policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schools are to act in the best interest of the child and protect 
children while in their care. We train educators to identify bullying 
behavior and signs of abuse in the home and the steps they can take to 
intervene. By forcing an educator to use "birth assigned sex" when 
determining names and pronouns of children and teens instead of 
respecting the student, this policy will out trans students who are 
socially transitioned but, for whatever reason, have not gone through 
the process to make legal changes, increasing their risk of assault and 
bullying. For some trans and non-binary students, school is the only 
safe space in their life and the educators they interact with who are 
respectful of them are the key protective factor that leads to survival.
 This policy will take that away from at-risk youth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this policy is enacted, suicides in LGBTQ+ youth, especially trans
 youth will increase. Bullying of these same youth will increase. 
Targeted attacks of these same youth will increase. These are hyperbolic
 statements, but facts based on data from organizations like the CDC, 
who recommend that schools provide safe spaces for all youth, especially
 LGBTQ+ youth to reduce teen suicides. A 2019 NIH study documented that 
real and perceived safety at school is a protective factor for trans 
students in reducing suicidal tendencies."</p>
<p>I ask you to prioritize the needs of children over the feelings of a 
few people with limited understanding of trans people and over the 
political aspirations of Governor Youngkin. Prioritize saving children 
and keeping schools safe for every child, regardless of anyone's 
personal belief system. Reject this cruel policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a parent of 3 kids in VA public schools, I completely oppose the suggested changes.&nbsp;<br>VA DOE currently has a fair and non discriminatory policy in place from 2021.&nbsp;<br>I do not agree w the proposed changes. We should protect trans kids.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The proposed policy is harmful to school districts.&nbsp; &nbsp;By 
creating barriers for trans children or any child that doesn't "fit in",
 you are creating a hostile environment that they must go to each and 
every day.&nbsp; The assumption that all parents are supportive of their
 children is wrong - many children see school as a safe haven - a place 
they can talk more freely without the fear of punishment for being 
LGBTQ+ from their parents or other family members.&nbsp; To not allow 
individuals to speak to others outside of their family unit subjects 
them to not only harm from parents who do not accept them, but self harm
 as well.&nbsp; On another note, the policy that children must be called
 by their given name is ridiculous.&nbsp; If someone is named Charles 
but wants to be called Chuck, will that be allowed?&nbsp; How about 
someone named Robert who would like to be called Bobby? I could go 
on.&nbsp; Please throw out this "policy" and follow the laws that were 
recently passed regarding acceptance of all children.</p>

<p>This Guidance Document is not only terrible for the health and safety
 of transgender students, it is directly antithetical to the goals laid 
out by the proposal itself. You state that a child's "distinctive 
abilities and characteristics... should be valued and respected", and 
that all children, including transgender children, have the right to 
attend school "in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, 
or bullying". Yet somehow, this proposal immediately turns against these
 promises, demanding teachers and faculty deadname &amp; use the wrong 
pronouns for transgender students, &amp; report any deviations from 
traditional gender identity to parents that could very well harass &amp;
 punish their child for feelings they cannot control. Rules like these 
do not discourage children from making a decision they'll regret, as 
some have suggested about trans children changing their name &amp; 
gender presentation &amp; taking hormone therapies; in fact, nearly 95% 
of trans individuals who undergo these procedures are extremely 
satisfied &amp; do not regret their decision, regardless of age. All 
these policies do is make transgender kids less comfortable in a school 
environment &amp; in their own bodies, and open up abuse by peers, 
teachers, &amp; the very same parents you claim have an inalienable 
right to control their children's lives. This rule is highly unethical 
&amp; does not respect the biological, psychological, and social 
realities of transgender students, and as a very concerned citizen I 
insist that you refuse its passage.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Thank you for supporting the right of 
parents to be involved in their child's education, and for refusing to 
allow teachers and administrators to encourage children to keep secrets 
about their physical and mental health from parents.&nbsp; Transitioning
 students without parents' knowledge can be detrimental to the child's 
health, particularly if&nbsp; hormones are involved.&nbsp; We can 
support transgender rights without trampling on the rights of the rest 
of the school or the parents.</p>

<p>Trans kids should have full and equal rights afforded all kids… and 
those who teach them should have no responsibility to change them or 
call them out. Leave trans kids alone and provide an educational space 
that is fully supportive of DEIA — centered on education and 
belonging&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>A Vague &amp; Harmful Policy That'll Harm Cisgender Students as Much a Trans Students</strong>
        </div>
        <div style="clear: right">&nbsp;</div>

        
        <div class="divComment">
          




<p>These policies are so harmful &amp; vague in how they limit the 
rights of children. Not even the rights of gender expression. The right 
to a child's very imagination. Are we supposed to tell elementary 
schoolers that they can't play around with creative nicknames? That a 
child named Edward can't be affectionately called Squidward by his 
friends, simply because it's not commonly associated with the legal 
name? What does "commonly associated" even mean? What guide are they 
going based off of for this? They don't provide one!</p>
<p>And how is it legal to say that a student's legal name and sex may 
not be changed? That's in direct violation of state laws! Are they 
trying to bankrupt Virginia schools with future court costs? Shouldn't 
this be left to the state lawmakers, so it doesn't invite legal conflict
 and opposition that could only reinforce the policies these new 
policies are replacing?</p>
<p>And what are they doing trying to place "trans-girls" with cisgender 
boys, and vice-versa? Are they encouraging illicit activities between 
students of opposite gender identities?</p>
<p>These rules are just as barbaric, if not more so, for cisgender 
students to adhere to as transgender students &amp; should be 
immediately recalled &amp; reconsidered!</p>

<p>These proposed 'regulations' are a horrific and monstrous attack on 
the right of transgender kids to simply be who they are, on their 
fundamental right to bodily autonomy and self-determination. Children 
are not the property of their parents, or of the state. They have the 
right to decide who they will be and to demand that we respect their 
choices. There is nothing wrong with being transgender--it is a normal 
and healthy part of human diversity. Transgender people have existed 
since the dawn of human civilization (and no doubt long before that) and
 will exist for epochs after our own civilization dwindles into dust. 
You cannot stamp gender diversity out by simply refusing to treat 
transgender people with basic human decency. All these regulations will 
do is cause harm to vulnerable young people who are just trying to live 
authentic lives as the people who they truly are. The regulations will 
inflict incredible pain and suffering on young people (pain and 
suffering which, if you are not trans yourselves, you cannot possibly 
begin to comprehend), which studies have shown can lead to lifelong 
mental illness, physical harm, and even death. These regulations are 
also against Virginia law as it concerns gender identity and equality in
 education. The governor's administration is attempting to circumvent 
the law to hurt vulnerable young people via administrative action, a 
truly heinous and illegal abuse of power. It will fail in the courts, 
but it should never be allowed to stand in the first place.</p>

<p>This policy as currently written will put many transgender children 
in a position where they will be at best not adequately supported, and 
at worst severely harmed. This policy should be revised, ideally with 
substantial input from relevant mental health experts and members of the
 transgender community to determine the best way to approach supporting 
transgender children and ensuring their safety and wellbeing.</p>

<p>Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter wrote in a statement: “It is not
 under a school’s or the government’s purview to impose a set of 
particular ideological beliefs on all students.” This is absolutely 
untrue since the Policy guidance on transgender students involves the 
Commonwealth government imposing its set of ideological beliefs on 
school students. What about the rights and freedoms of those students, 
and of their teachers, to make informed choices on their own, without 
government interference?</p>
<p>This policy guidance should be eliminated.</p>

<p>I am against Youngkin and the GOP's proposed student policy.</p>
<p>In spite of the good fortune and privileges life has given me, my 
time in grade school was a difficult one, primarily because of direct 
and indirect harassments from other students. I cannot imagine how much 
more difficult it is for LGBTQ students trying to go through school, 
knowing that both their peers AND the education system (and by extent 
the government) would enforce a policy that would coerce them to either 
conform to&nbsp; christo-conservative desires, or expel them from sight 
and mind.</p>
<p>This policy and its enforcement condemns LGBTQ, as if their existence
 is something to be shunned, by providing zero recourse for any 
harassment or harmful actions against them.</p>
<p>Further, it endangers the students in question by forcing staff to 
"out" them to their parents or guardians, who themselves may be 
violently bigoted towards LGBTQ; The policymakers and enforcers pretend 
their hands are clean from any harm that comes to the students.</p>
<p>Do not pass this policy. I want the younger generations to become 
smarter and kinder, to feel safe that they can talk about who they are 
and that they can have some confidence that they'll be able to grow up 
and grow old; this policy confirms neither.</p>

<p>I have proudly taught LGBTQ+ students in the past and will continue 
to do moving forward. This policy is yet another detestable effort to 
engage in LGBTQ+ erasure in our schools by forcing LGBTQ+ students, 
transgender students in particular to hide and/or deny their identities 
for fear that their teachers and school staff will be forced to "out" 
them to their parents, which will lead to verbal, emotional, and/or 
physical abuse and/or being kicked out of their homes. It is also 
designed to scare teachers and school staff to do the bidding of the 
"Moms For Liberty" crowd.</p>
<p>This policy, which was likely heavily influenced by right-wing 
special interests is intentionally cruel, and has no place in a 
Commonwealth which slogan is "Virginia is for Lovers" in reference to 
the Loving v Virginia case that ended bans on interracial marriage.</p>
<p>If this awful policy is enacted it will be resisted by some of the 
largest school districts in the Commonwealth and rightfully so, and as a
 teacher of 17 years, I have no intention of supporting it.</p>

<p>I love this new revised policy because it keeps everyone in mind. It 
creates more trust between schools and parents. It also creates a 
positive working relationship between parties.&nbsp;</p>

are grown adults, and you don't like a group of people because they are 
different than you all? Seriously? Grow up, and mind your own business.</p>

<p>I strongly support this. Finally, some common sense. <br>The Left, 
with its unhinged and amoral views, are destroying our country. Thanks 
to the Left, our education system is worse than it’s ever been, and 
students are dumber than ever. I teach on the medical campus, and I’m 
appalled by how stupid the students are. Everything that the Left does, 
they seek to destroy the greatness of this country. Trans kids 
&nbsp;need help. &nbsp;Democrats need help. &nbsp;Thank you, Youngkin, 
for stopping the brainwashing that the has permeated our schools.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I am infuriated that our Virginia public 
schools think they can brainwash my kids without my knowledge and 
without consequences! Parents should be the ultimate authority over 
their own children and the schools actions while on school property. 
This should include course curriculum and behavioral topics such as 
homosexuality and the like. HOW DARE a school staff try to hide 
information about a student from their own parents or guardian!! Shame 
on you Loudoun County School board!&nbsp;</p>

          <strong>Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public Schools</strong>

<div>Regarding the subject item, I am all for respecting people having 
the ability to choose the direction to go with their lives except when 
that choice adversely affects those around them.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>School boards and school systems must be held accountable for 
enabling behavior that results in the sexual abuse of others, as was the
 case in Loudon County with the so-called "transgender" student, a 
biological male, who went into a girl's school restroom and sexually 
assaulted a girl there. Any attempt by school boards and school systems 
to cover up sexual assault and intimidation must be stopped and not 
covered up, which the Loudon County school system has been trying to 
do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The resulting backlash from this event and the position taken by 
the Democrat party to try silencing parents from having a say in their 
kid's education and labeling such parents "terrorists" for holding 
school boards accountable for sexual abuse resulted in last November's 
election of of a governor who is demonstrating that all Virginia Parents
 matter. They should have a say in their child's education.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please support governor Glenn Youngkin’s new K-12 policies, which 
empower parents, restore common-sense to our schools, and protect our 
children.</div>

<p>We need to do everything we can as a society to protect our children.
 To exclude transgendered invididuals from this protection is 
exceptionally problematic and malicious. Transgendered youths should not
 be exposed to this kind of hatred and deserve to live, love, and learn 
with as much freedom as any cisgendered youth. We cannot let these 
hateful policies go into effect. Protect Trans students at all costs!</p>

 Thank you for writing a common-sense model policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">I strongly oppose this proposed policy.&nbsp; This proposal
 would create a hostile and potentially dangerous school environment for
 our <strong>own granddaughter</strong> and all VA transgender and 
nonbinary youth, requiring teachers and staff to forcibly “out” 
students, prohibit staff from supporting trans and nonbinary students 
such as using a students affirming name and pronouns, and prohibit 
access or participation in activities consistent with their gender 
identity.&nbsp; All our students deserve a supportive and affirming 
school environment, especially our vulnerable and marginalized 
populations like our transgender and nonbinary youth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">PLEASE REJECT this new proposal!</p>

<p>I vehemently oppose this cruel and harmful policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studies show that 40% of trans youth have attempted suicide. 82% have contemplated it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could be your child, your niece or nephew, your child's best friend, or a friend's child. It could be anyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a personal topic for each individual, not one that should be 
determined by any politician. This is absolutely cruel and we should be 
supporting all kids in schools in any way possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not a liberal or conservative topic it's a HUMAN topic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The oppression of trans people is anti-American. Liberty for all 
applies to trans people and if it doesn’t, than none of us are free. 
Imposing laws that oppress trans people is what fascists do. These bills
 should be frustrated at all costs if we actually care about freedom for
 all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a trans person, it is very obvious how if these policies go into 
effect it will hurt trans youth and cost lives. I had already graduated 
high school when the previous guidelines &nbsp;requiring schools to 
adopt evidence based policies that support trans and non-binary youth 
went into effect. My school wasn’t kind to trans kids; teachers outed 
students to their families, kids bullied lgbt students without 
consequence, it wasn’t an option to change our name or participate in 
events/use facilities that were separated by gender- basically the 
environment &nbsp;that these guidelines would call for. Because of this,
 and already facing bullying for being a queer POC, I didn’t come out as
 transgender until well into adulthood. My educational environment being
 so openly transphobic made me ashamed to be trans and I suppressed my 
gender identity for a long time. This of course had a negative impact on
 my mental health and cost me years of my life I will never get back. I 
often think about how different things could have been if as a teenager I
 had access to life changing and life saving policies that protect and 
support trans and non-binary youth. For example, I would have been more 
comfortable making friends, would have focused better in class and spent
 less time worrying and trying to suppress a key part of who I am, I 
would have joined a sports team, and I would have started college 
confidently and authentically my full self.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All kids should have the opportunity for a complete childhood where 
they are supported by their teachers and peers, and can explore who they
 are in a safe and loving environment. My heart breaks for the trans and
 non-binary youth who’s lives are being used as a political pawn. This 
administration is signaling to the most vulnerable population that they 
do not matter and aren’t to be trusted, no kid should be made to feel 
that way.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>Attacking queer youth and education is going to come back to bite the
 Republican Party in a few short years when these newly politicized 
teenagers reach voting age.</p>

<p>It is beyond debate that the right to do with ones body as they will 
is among the core and essential human rights afforded to us by our very 
existence as human beings, but if we must cite a document like the 
constitution instead we may. We are to be secure in our own persons, and
 that includes issues of bodily appearance and issues of identity. Many 
of the proponents for outing trans youth cite a vested interest of the 
parents, but we cannot treat all parents as equals in regards to safety 
or love. One needs only to give a passing glance to the treatment 
experienced by most of the LGBTQ+ community to realize the harm it could
 cause many children and teenagers to be outed to their abusive 
parent/parents. The choice to discuss such matters, or anything else, 
should be left to those most directly effected by that choice; and that 
is not the parent.</p>

<p>&nbsp; This will undeniably put thousands of kids into dangerous 
situations and make their lives miserable.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This act 
is unconscionable, and clearly a form of targeted legislative bigotry 
and harassment.</p>

<p>Many people do not understand the experience of transgender 
individuals, however this should not allow for treating them with 
anything less than full respect. There are many distressing scenarios 
that could come from these new policies. Outing trans kids to less than 
understanding parents could do harm. Outing trans kids to peers could do
 harm. Schools should be able to follow a trans kid's lead on how they 
will feel most supported and safe.</p>

<p>What is it with playing politics with the most vulnerable groups to 
score political points? It’s not like the idiots who are afraid of 
everybody can vote twice. It’s almost as if you don’t believe in 
democracy in the first place. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Students should feel safe at school. Trans students deserve to feel 
just as safe and heard as any other child. They are also there to learn.
 That includes learning about other people. Kids get it - they always 
see everything different as a good thing, or, at minimum, something to 
be witnessed wholeheartedly. If the adults representing these children 
are so ignorant and uncomfortable with showing students that other sorts
 of people exist, then what are we teaching them? That if you are afraid
 of something (or someone), you should ignore it? Or, in this proposal, 
actively harm them? This policy is setting our next generation back 
decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transgender youth are subject to violence based on their gender 
identity, and suffer substance abuse, homelessness, suicidality, child 
welfare involvement and other negative outcomes at distressingly higher 
rates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are slowly coming out of a pandemic that has led to staggering 
rises in mental health concerns among children and teens. Transgender 
children had statistically higher rates of depression and suicidal 
ideation before the pandemic: around half of transgender youth consider 
suicide, and a third attempt it.</p>
<p>Politics has no place here. Transgender children, like all children, just want to belong.</p>

<p>there is no reason to single out trans kids for abuse by schools, 
parents and peers, this helps no one and hurts everyone. it's nothing 
more than state sanctioned abuse of children. it's gross, monsterous and
 evil.</p>

<p>As a pediatric nurse practitioner, I know that all students are 
undergoing a great deal of stress post pandemic, but those at highest 
risk are transgender students. The rules proposed, I believe, are not 
appropriate under HIPPA regulations, and are certainly an assault on a 
student’s privacy, and could negatively impact their safety and mental 
health. Children should be called by the names they choose, not the 
names that the State decrees. &nbsp;Teachers should not have to report 
students. This will cause extreme risk to some children. Do not 
misgender children. They know who they are, and who they need to be, not
 the Virginia Department of Education. Do not enact these onerous, 
deadly policies.</p>

<p>This new policy is harmful to trans and non/binary youth. It will 
drives more and more kids to suicide. What Governor Youngkin and the 
VDOE is doing is extremely wrong. We cannot stand for this and we will 
not stand for this</p>

<p>For some children school is their safe space where they can be 
themselves when it is not possible at home. For some children being able
 to have their teachers validate their identity with their names and 
pronouns can help make their lives just a bit less depressing. Suicide 
is one of the major causes of death for those in the LGBTQ+ community, 
especially trans people, taking away some of the few ways that they can 
be validated in their identity is horrible. Plus, some kids may not want
 other children (i. e. bullies) to know about them being trans and 
having a different name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allow these kids to be called what they want by the few people in 
their lives who may be able to make them feel safe and valid, don’t take
 this away from them, please.</p>

<p>I cannot believe that kindness is now a radical, rebellious act. A 
teacher simply calling their student by their proper name which they 
identify with, is an act of kindness, not a political standpoint. What 
is the difference between a student who was named Christopher at birth 
asking to be called Chris and a student who was named Hannah at birth 
asking to be called Preston? I am currently a student at James Madison 
University's College of Education and this proposed policy has been a 
recurring topic in my education classes. During class discussion, it has
 been made clear that&nbsp;<strong>all</strong> of my classmates oppose 
this policy. And speaking for myself, when I am a teacher, no matter the
 outcome of this policy, I will be calling my students exactly what they
 want to be called, no matter what is on their birth certificate. No 
matter if I lose my job. Why are we, as a country, demonizing kindness? 
Why does our government want us to be unkind to our young students?</p>

<p>Research overwhelmingly suggests rules such as these harm children.

<p>The changes that are being proposed are a draconian misstep that is 
being driven by those in the Commonwealth that are demanding that 
Christian dogma and ideology be forced upon those that do not practice 
Christianity. This is wrong, let alone unconstitutional, to force a 
specific religious beliefs onto the residents of the Commonwealth that 
are not Christian. Additionally as soon as some of these proposals are 
enacted there will be lawsuits and once again the residents of the 
Commonwealth will be asked again to defend Christianity with our tax 
dollars. This is also wrong. Please do away with these proposed changes 
and stop forcing the Christian religion on the citizens of the 
Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;I oppose Gov. Youngkin's new guidelines regarding transgendered
 students. I want Virginia DOE to maintain a safe and supportive 
learning environment free from discrimination and harassment for <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span></em>
 students. Virginia DOE to everything to prevent bullying and 
harassment, and protect all students' privacy and the confidentiality of
 sensitive information.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for instituting these policies and safeguarding our
 children from learning about obscene behavior. The sexual atrocities 
practiced today are an abomination to God and have no place in the 
educational system of our state or nation.</p>

<p>Following through with this will bring further harm to trans 
children. I strongly oppose this and am disappointed that this is hidden
 behind the facade of "empowering parents" when it simply makes 
children's lives harder.</p>

<p>This is going to hurt queer kids, if not kill them. Preventing a 
child from transitioning doesn’t stop them from being trans, but it does
 hurt them. Kids should be given freedom to safely explore who they are 
and how they exist in this world. It’s not freedom of speech to be 
allowed to misgender them or deadname them. It’s disrespectful.</p>

<p>I love FCPS policy that allows me to shower with girls in the locker

<p>I'm curious Mr. Youngkin, did you speak with any trans children and 
young adults before drafting this plan of yours? It does not have their 
best interests at heart. It discriminates and identifies a person in a 
way that will only cause harm. To misgender someone who identifies a 
certain way that is unacceptable to the parents and therefore can't get 
the formal name change is to take away the individual's basic human 
rights.</p>
<p>I question why you are doing this? Why this intrusion into a person's
 private identity when instead you could be addressing the global 
problem of climate change or the national problem of mass shootings. But
 no, you are fixated on how a child identifies for gender. Truly 
disappointing.</p>

<p>I am thankful that you have given parents their right to control what
 their children learn. Our kids deserve to be educated not groomed. 
However, the whole public education system needs a total overhaul! Why 
are teachers being pushed out and cannot find subs or have teachers 
aides? Why are public schools teaching fluff instead of true history?? 
Our public education system is failing our children! They cannot read or
 write. My granddaughter was so far ahead of her class and after seeing 
what they are teaching, I pulled her out of public school. I am on a 
fixed income and have sacrificed everything so she will have the BEST 
education and that definitely doesn't come from public school. Schools 
are shortstaffed and are in big trouble in SW Virginia. It is a shame 
that the DOE doesn't do a better job for our children.</p>

<p>These proposed changes to the Virginia DOE policies will endanger 
trans youth and all other students. They are internally inconsistent and
 blatantly discriminatory. I oppose all elements of this proposal. Trans
 students should not be forcibly outed to anyone they do not wish to be 
out to. Some kids may lose housing as a result of being forcibly outed. 
Trans students should not have to endure even more in the endless 
barrage of being misgendered in their lives. School is a place to learn.
 Let trans kids learn in peace. Their lives are already hard enough and 
school may be one of the few places they can achieve success or peace - 
do not rob them of it. The overwhelming majority of data shows 
unambiguously that supporting and affirming trans kids (using their 
correct pronouns i.e. the ones they choose, allowing them to see 
positive representations of trans people, access to affirming medical 
treatment such as counseling and hormones as the standard practice with 
all patients as determined by doctors etc) is strongly correlated with 
better mental health outcomes. This means decreased depression, 
increased happiness, and critically a drop in suicidality. As a 
population extremely vulnerable to harassment, discrimination, and 
outright violence - trans kids and people need as much protection as 
possible. Any amount of research will show that what I say here is true.
 If you are reading this you are probably an adult who knows how to use a
 library or at the very least google scholar. Go and find what 
prestigious medical associations say about protecting trans people. 
Seriously, go and find out yourself. read through the data and learn 
that we are normal people who need to be supported not attacked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not explicitly work to defend marginalized children, then 
you have no honor. If the Virginia BOE decides to go through with this 
proposal and explicitly discriminate against marginalized children then 
it is not an institution that deserves respect or regard. If you adopt 
this proposal, children will die. The people of Virginia demand that you
 stop politicizing the lives of marginalized children and let them learn
 in peace. Halt this proposal immediately.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am a mental health counselor in Virginia and I can easily say that 
this policy will make children feel unsafe and make it more difficult 
for them to ask for help for mental health issues. It will open up 
schools to increased lawsuits when it inevitably leads to increased 
suicides, bullying, and general discrimination by the schools against 
students.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am a teacher in Northern Virginia and I have many trans and 
non-binary students. These proposed policies are detrimental to the 
mental health and overall well-being of these students. The policies are
 clearly not meant to provide support to families who do have 
trans/non-binary students or else it would be easier for families to 
change student pronouns or names for schools.&nbsp; Requiring the legal 
documents provides undue burden on supporting families. This pilicy just
 alianiates children who already do not feel supported by society. 
Additionally, should I not call any Jonathan's John without permission? 
Bobby and Robbie instead of Robert? This also provides more burden on 
teachers who are already overwhelmed, overworked, and 
undersupported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This policy endangers transgendered and questioning youth who are 
already vulnerable and are also a protected class. Moreover, it is poor 
policy that invites litigation under Title IX, no matter one's opinion, 
ideology, or theology regarding gender identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I agree with the proposed rules for transgender students. Parents 
should have the say, not schools. Schools are for learning, not trying 
to push others beliefs on students. You are male or female...end of

<p>...that's an attempt at an "end run" around the will of the people as
 voted on by the VA Legislature. The Governor is attempting to force 
social policy that was rejected by the Legislature and the voters.</p>

<p>Thank God for Governor Youngkin and his courage to stand up to the 
radicals who use bullying tactics to dissuade people from stating 
obvious truths. &nbsp;There is absolutely nothing anti-anybody or 
anti-anything in these policies. &nbsp;They are simple guidelines for 
treating students and parents with respect while focusing on education 
in our schools.</p>

<p>Model Policy G.3 states: "<span id="page59R_mcid4"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Students shall use bathrooms that correspond to his or her sex, except to the </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">extent that federal law otherwise requires. See</span> <span dir="ltr" role="presentation">Grimm v. Gloucester County</span><br role="presentation"><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">School Board</span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">, 972 F.3d 586 (2020)</span></span> "</p>
<p>In Grimm v. Gloucester County, the fourth circuit ruled that 
requiring trans students to use bathrooms that correspond to their 'sex'
 violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the equal 
protection clause of the Constitution. Whoever wrote this document must 
have known that, and still wrote a model policy that violates it.</p>
<p>This is among other issues with this policy. Accommodating trans students at school is the best way to keep them alive.</p>

<p>Caring for the safety, upbringing, and education of children should 
be of utmost importance within our schools and communities - this policy
 does the opposite. The goal of these policies is to shame, silence, and
 deny the existence of trans people. This policy change is inherently 
dangerous. Children deserve better. Schools should be a safe space for 
ALL children. Schools should be dedicated to creating an environment in 
which children learn and grow. This policy attempts to force the hands 
of teachers/school administrators to create and uphold a dangerous 
environment for children. I am vehemently against this policy.</p>

<p>As a Virginia citizen and a transgender person, I moved here because I
 believed it was safer for my human rights to happiness and dignity than
 my home state. Growing up a transgender kid in a transphobic, 
unaccepting home and school made me almost take my own life multiple 
times. Policies like these that put transgender students IN DANGER will 
cause children to DIE, either from their own hand or by their abusive 
parents. I personally know many of my friends who were afraid to go home
 every night to their parents, in case they found out they were queer or
 trans, and serious harmed if not killed them. If you believe in 
protecting children, then give them spaces to explore their feelings and
 identities without shame and harm. If you are afraid of children being 
"convinced" to be transgender, then allow them spaces where it's okay to
 be fluid and be different. Forcing conformity ONLY hurts. I am 
absolutely disgusted at the idea that we would ever put children in such
 DANGEROUS situations, as forcing them to be OUTED and potentially 
HARMED. I STRONGLY OPPOSE this legislation.</p>

<p>Strongly oppose this. Schools are meant to enable children to grow 
beyond the scope of their upbringing. Parents already have the choice to
 opt out of using public services. If a few parents want to protect 
their children from knowing the extent of freedom that is available to 
them as Americans, let them stay home rather than let them stifle the 
speech and actions of the rest of us, our children, and our teachers.</p>

<p>Trans children are being used a political pawns and scapegoats. These
 policies protect no one and will subject an already maligned group of 
children--yes, children--to invasions of privacy and additional bullying
 and harassment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>This proposed policy is hateful. Trans and nonbinary youth 
need to be protected, supported, and affirmed, not forcibly "outed". 
Prohibiting staff from <strong>using trans and nonbinary kids' affirming name and pronouns </strong>and
 prohibiting their access and participation in activities consistent 
with their gender identities is wrong. It will harm already vulnerable 
kids. Do NOT enact this policy.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This proposed set of regulations is Governor Youngkin's dog whistle 
to right wing radicals in his base. He hopes this will help position him
 for a presidential run. I suppose he can hope but thinking people will 
see right through this nonsense.</p>
<p>I am strongly opposed to everything in the proposed regulations. They
 will do nothing but hurt trans kids who are already vulnerable and 
often in fragile mental health.&nbsp;Recognizing a child's own sense of 
who they are and supporting it doesn't cost anything and doesn't hurt 
anyone. There is absolutely no reason to approve these proposed 
regulations.</p>

<p>As a Virginia Alexandria city student and a cousin of a trans youth I
 strongly disagree with this bill. I have always believed that school 
should be a place that is safe for students and growing up everyone told
 me that it was a safe place. Students are now scared. No one should be 
scared to go to school and to get a basic education. Whether or not 
someone is transgender or just prefer different pronouns shouldn’t make 
their education difficult to get or make school an unsafe environment. 
How someone wants to be identified as shouldn’t concern someone else. At
 this point it’s not just politics and getting a good reputation for 
your party it is just flat out discrimination and disrespectful. You are
 just going over the line with this bill. No one should be scared to go 
to school and you are making everyone feel unsafe transgender or not. 
Whats next classrooms for girls and classrooms for boys? Only female 
teachers? Girls can only wear dresses and skirts and boys can only wear 
pants and shorts? I sure hope not. It is 2022. I should be proud of 
everything this generation is doing and what we don’t have ti go 
through, but I’m not at all I’m actually very upset. we don’t live in 
the 1900s anymore. It is 2022. I really hope everyone thinks this 
through and change this. Again people shouldn’t be scared to go to 
school.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I highlight problems in Section V Development, Paragraph C:</p>
<ol>
<li>"The First Amendment forbids government actors to require 
individuals to adhere to or adopt any particular ideological beliefs. 
Practices such as compelling others to use preferred pronouns is 
premised on the ideological belief that gender is a matter of personal 
choice or subjective experience, not sex. Many Virginians reject this 
belief."&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some Virginians might reject this "belief". However, <strong>many</strong> <strong>Virginians accept this fact</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.&nbsp; "Additionally, the First 
Amendment guarantees religious freedom and prohibits compelling others 
to affirm ideas that may be contrary to their personal religious 
beliefs."</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You do not have the right to compel others to affirm your beliefs. <strong>Trans people exist regardless of anyone's religious beliefs.</strong> They have the right to be themselves and to attend school in safety and peace.</p>

<p>A parent has a right to help decide the child's Education, Safety and
 Fair treatment in schools. They do not have a right to choose whether 
their child's "orientation" is A or B. A lot of student's only escape 
from overbearing or abusive family is the school system. Students who 
can be themselves without worry or abuse are students who learn the 
best. We need our schools to provide a space where kids can learn and be
 themselves in an open and safe way.</p>
<p>Only in one notion this Policy is correct, schools aren't here to 
raise our kids. Yet it goes on to counter this notion, it wants schools 
to act as an extension of the parents. But schools are here to educate, 
instruct, and provide options to the students. The student themselves 
determine what to do with this knowledge. THE STUDENT ALONE DECIDES WHO 
THEY ARE! This VA administration was a mistake, but we will fix it by 
voting next election.</p>

          <strong>This updated model policy will put children in danger</strong>

<p>The model policies on the privacy, dignity, and respect for all 
students and parents in Virginia’s public schools is a dangerous policy 
with a disingenuous title. &nbsp;This will put more children in harm’s 
way due to domestic abuse and increase the incidence of suicide among 
kids and teens. &nbsp;Many young people who are questioning their gender
 identity consider suicide if they conclude that they are gender 
nonconforming or trans, but cannot safely discuss it with their parents.
 &nbsp;In these cases, a supportive teacher and school system can be a 
lifeline for them. &nbsp;Additionally, it is a sad fact that some 
parents will abuse a child they perceive to be gender nonconforming or 
trans. &nbsp;Exposing these vulnerable children to such negative 
outcomes is unconscionable, and has no place in a state with a slogan of
 “Virginia is for Lovers.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be urging my state senator and state delegate to do whatever 
they can to blunt or reverse this model policy, should it move 
forward.&nbsp;</p>

 I am a private music teacher. I In the last 5 years, I have had at 
least 7 (more than 25% of my student population) private students 
navigate this particular identity crisis. As you might know, teens 
devoted to the arts tend to examine themselves before the broader 
population of adolescents.&nbsp; They wind up courageously leading the 
charge for social change. A residual consequence of the Governor’s Model
